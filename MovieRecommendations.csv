I would give his cinematographer's name, but even though I know it, I know I'd spell it wrong.   I've heard the movie Paprika had a great influence on Inception so I don't quite know exactly how original it actually is, but rest assured, it's definitely unique among mega budgeted action films.

What I saw was, without a doubt, the craziest film Martin Scorsese has ever made! And it was amazing to say the least! The over-the-top sex, drugs, and language play out humorously, which is different for Scorsese, as he usually aims for dramatic when it comes to those sorts of things. Nevertheless, it works perfectly! The story of Jordan Belfort transitions from comedic and crazy in the first half to dramatic and serious in the second! Both aspects worked perfectly in detailing his crazy, messed up life. DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is flawless and should go down as his best performance in his entire career! Jonah Hill was often times hilarious and made for a great comic relief in the more dramatic and serious parts of the film. Matthew McConaughey was very thought-provoking and funny in his small role at the beginning. All of the other supporting cast members did great and helped this film run along smoothly.

The reason why I think the directing in this movie was so excellent is because while watching the movie I got that feeling of someone breathing down your neck kind of feel that only happens when everything is shot, acted, and directed excellently. Michael really injects the sense of anxiety and the feeling of being watched, and that was through the camera work and the directing. All throughout the movie I thought I was watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie, because this movie got the Hitchcock brilliance written all over it; you could say it's a modern day Hitchcock film that Alfred himself never directed.

Maybe a \""10\"" isn't a balanced score, but I am hard pressed to think of a movie in recent memory that had me so wired and on the edge of my seat.  Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic and the cast surrounding her all turn in great performances as well.  This Hunger Games is more visceral - I didn't want it to end, ever. We'll get Mockingjay to close out the trilogy and I was thrilled to hear that it will be a two-part movie.  It's just sad to think that there can only be one more complete chapter in what has quickly become the coolest franchise since Harry Potter, especially as The Hobbit has turned out to be nothing special.  To Danny Strong (screenwriter) I say: do us proud - Suzanne Collins' oversight will do wonders to keep the movies faithful, but it's your transition from literary fiction to silver-screen entertainment that needs to land the most.  So excited."" ]";1;1;1;0;2;0.25
interstellar;10;SchroederRock;/user/SchroederRock;Mar 24, 2015;"[ ""Few movies can match both the intelligence and imagination brought forth by Interstellar, which I found has everything I could ever want in a movie.  Not a moment goes by that feels overly bland or useless - quite the feat given the 2 hrs. 50 minutes total runtime.  Interstellar does carry a lot of science and theories that are used throughout the film to make sense of what is happening.  This gives a lot of creative license to Christopher Nolan, who progresses the story through creativity without ejecting audiences uncontrollably. The great thing about Nolan's approach in Interstellar is that we can't really say for sure he's right or wrong, because the movie operates on existing facts and theories in regards to space and time.  But what really anchors this movie is the sentiment of relationships - of how love is an immeasurable force that has yet to be quantified or measured in any meaningful way.  And, without using dialogue or narration, the \""5th dimension\"" experience later in the movie is somewhat explained by the final seconds of the film (not a spoiler) - something I think people could have missed on a first pass.  If you loved Gravity, you're like to praise Interstellar ten-fold."" ]";0;2;0;2;2;0.25

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the world's most famous G Man and Armie Hammer plays his faithful confidant and friend, Clyde Tolson while Naomi Watts portrays the role of Helen Gandy, J. Edgar's ever loyal secretary and girl Friday. The film was written by Dustin Lance Black and produced and directed by Clint Eastwood,. Although interesting from the point of view of the history of the nation's most famous crime fighting organization, I'm sorry to say that the film was much too long. Instead of shortening Hoover's name in the title of the film, the editors should have deleted a lot of unnecessary footage as the movie struggles to find itself and its proper pace.  In this case FBI could stand \""For Boring Individuals\"". Even good things should end in a timely manner. This is not the Clint Eastwood we came to know in \""The Unforgiven\"" or his other great films. It was almost as if pride of directorship and artistic endeavor overrode the necessity to make the film work in a tighter vehicle.

This movie stars Michelle Williams (as Marilyn Monroe), Kenneth Branagh (as Sir Laurence), Eddie Redmayne (as Colin Clark) and other cast members including Julia Ormond, Judi Dench and Emma Watson (HarryPotter). Written by Adrian Hodges and directed by Simon Curtis the film is slow moving and oftentimes trite in its dialogue as it seeks to penetrate the life and psyche of Ms. Monroe. This complicated icon is portrayed by Michelle Williams in an uncanny and extraordinary manner that, regardless of the merits (or demerits) of the film, will certainly earn her Oscar consideration in 2012. Ms. Williams becomes Ms. Monroe and gives the performance of her career as she captures her character's nuances and likenesses to such an extent that even Meryl Streep would be forced to sit up and give a nod of approval. The film, under normal circumstances, deserves only a 7 rating ut because of Ms. Williams' performance, I give it an 8.

I saw the \""Exorcist\"" and everyone was laughing the whole way through the movie. Good thing because I was scared to death watching it. \""Left Behind\"" had its moments of scariness, humor and absurdity. The acting was fine. However, at times some of the acting was way exaggerated for the scene, which means, it's the director's fault. Like the actors would be really scared, then calm down too quick in the next scene even though the problem is getting worse. That's not bad acting, that's bad directing and bad editing. But we still liked the movie. We try to go to all the religious movies that make you think, not the ones that praise religion. But we especially like the religious movies with action (The Matrix had a lot of religious undertones). Boyfriend is a believer, I'm not sure if I am, but I used to be. So we saw the movie with different mind frames and still enjoyed it because it showed how different people are about religion. I'd be like Nicholas Cage. Give me a sign and I'm believing again.

Each fragment has its own intrigue worthy of having an individual movie, but here they blend perfectly, jumping from one to other, enriching the next sequences. The protagonists are developed in a very realistic form, with respect but not gently at all, we reach the center of each one, you get to know what moves them, what hunts them, which are their profound desires. As the plot reveals the conflict you realize that not everything is white and black, while one character emerges the other collapses. The secondary roles are not forgotten; everyone has their own struggles, that are independent of the main conflict, but leads them to participate. All these thoughts and feelings are sublimated at the end, in a visceral scene marked by a lack of empathy that is breathtaking. Amy Adams is marvelous, one the best performance of her career, the way she moves, her expressions, skin tone and eyes from a person with the fatigue of living many lives.

Because of that the picture is constructed within three worlds, the horrible present (the movie), the repressed past (in flashbacks) and the fantastic other reality (breaking the flashbacks). That is why especial technical aspects are used to narrate the story, like slow motion shots, changes in illumination and audio-visual counterpoint (when in a fight it sounds quiet music).

Many movies that tell a true story simply go through the motions, relying on everyone's recognition of the events to do the heavy lifting, but not Foxcatcher.  Bennett Miller directs it with tension, detail and cinematic flourish.  Steve Carrel proves to be a more than solid dramatic actor.  He's creepy, strange, and yet somehow still garners sympathy.  I'm not sure what his performance would seem like without all that makeup, although I'm sure it would still be more than adequate.  Ruffalo and Tatum are also great, and maybe even better than Carrel, but he does stand out more due to his odd and sometimes villainous behavior.

There are some scenes in this movie that are simply jaw dropping, especially the battle sequences.  The visual effects WILL at least get an Oscar nomination, unless either a miracle or giant pretentious snub occurs.  Dawn is more akin to the atmospheric and eerie movie that I wanted Rise to be.  Don't get me wrong, that was still a decent movie, but Dawn makes it look like crap in almost every area, except cgi.

Nearly every performance is shockingly good, even by the standards of this ensemble.  The one I was most impressed with had to be Bale.  His character was so far removed from his usual roles that at times I just had to laugh in astonished disbelief for how strange it was to see him like this.

Believable performances, for the most part incredible special effects, Jackson's expert direction, and real emotion make this a must own.

The unique bleached look to the film is just about perfect, and the futuristic world of the film is impressive.  It has moments of true emotion and the acting is just about flawless as well.  It's only flaws are that the last couple of minutes weren't that great, and some of the cop on the run action wasn't as engaging as it should have been.  Not that no action was any good, it's just that some big moments fell kinda flat.  These are just nitpicks however in a film destined to be remembered as a classic.

It's more like an actual crime thriller than a comic book movie.  It's dark, well acted, at times unerving, and probably as close to reality as a superhero movie can be.  Nolan's direction, especially in the action department, is nearly impecable.  The cinematogrophy is also excellent.  As everyone who seen this knows, the best part of the film is Ledger's joker.  It's probably the most disturbing  take on a familliar character ever devised.  However, I due have some nitpickings.  If you've seen the crow you know that Nolan has borrowed a few elements from that film including the look of the joker.  One other small problem is that when Bale is dressed as Batman in a scene where he is just talking to someone it seems kinda silly, especially with that voice he makes.  Also, in my opinion, Maggie Gyllenhol, (I think that's how you spell it), is too ugly for her role.  But ultimately the film is so far ahead of its superhero movie counterparts in terms of screenplay, directing, acting, and cinematogrophy that these things don't leave much of a negative impact.

They direct it with such obsessive detail in every little action that it's impossible not to be impressed with their work here.  I like a lot of their movies, but none of them can match this one's sublime mix of violence, story, and character.  Anton Chigur has to be one of the top five screen villains of all time.

There are so many fascinating, creepy, and even disturbing aspects about the relationship between Starling and Lector, but I'll let you find this out for yourself.  The characters here are as nuanced as I've ever seen.  Foster's performance is also excellent.  I must warn you, it's a graphic, disturbing, and at times even disgusting film, and on a different note some of the technical aspects of the movie haven't aged so well, but all in all, it's so memorable and haunting that I have to call it an absolute horror/crime classic.  I'll admit, I've had nightmares where I was in a building with Hannibal on the loose.  Those were some scary dreams."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0.125

Upon my second viewing however, I realized that there could have been a couple more of these types of moments placed into certain parts of the film.  The drama is all very well executed, but sometimes the movie does go a little too long without any action.  But this is still a film that hits you on much deeper levels than any action scene ever could.  Its ambition, imagination, and humanity are nearly unmatched.

However, it is most certainly yet another great addition to director David O. Russell's line of films. The story and pacing felt a little stuck at times. But really, it's the acting and the intriguing cast that makes this movie great! Christian Bale puts on a few pounds as the unpredictable con man, Irving. Bradley Cooper's performance as a crooked FBI agent served as one of the more memorable male performances in the film. Amy Adams is daring as Bale's love interest. Jeremy Renner gives a worthwhile goody two-shoes performance as the mayor. And last, but absolutely not least, Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all in what may well be her fiercest performance yet. The plot was also intelligent and well done for the most part, but like I said, it's really the characters that make this movie. David O. Russell even said it himself that he likes to focus on and prioritize characters more than plot. In this film's case, it fortunately worked. So overall, if you're a fan of David O. Russell's previous films (or films with interesting characters,) there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this, because this may be one of his best films yet."" ]";3;6;3;3;1;0.125

While the film doesn't necessarily have any Oscar-worthy performances, everyone does so well with how long it took to make the film. Ellar Coltrane is fun to watch as he grows older and the many different events that unfold around him throughout his life. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette give great and honest performances as his parents. The only weak performance was from Linklater's own daughter Lorelei.

the-revenant-2015;9;moviemitch96;/user/moviemitch96;Jan  9, 2016;"[ ""I had the chance to read Michael Punke's novel that this was based on before seeing this. So when watching the film, I noticed that it was straying awfully far away from what was happening in the book and at first I was disappointed. However, by the time the film ended, I understood more why this was the case. First off, the credits read \""based in part on the novel by Michael Punke\"", so that was a dead giveaway right there. Also, Punke couldn't promote, do any publicity, or even be on set or aid in the making of the film due to the fact that he's currently an ambassador to the World Trade Organization, which prevented him from helping the filmmakers include many of the events from the novel. I also realized that since so little is known about what happened with the real-life Hugh Glass that multiple stories and plot points can be made up about him. Even Punke admitted to having to make up several events that were in the novel. So basically Punke was telling his own version of what Glass might've been through or experienced, while the filmmakers were telling their own as well. For these reasons, I'm able to forgive the fact that the film drastically strayed from the novel. In fact, the more I thought about it after the film ended, the more I realized that I actually liked the film better, because the third act in the novel kind of strayed from the revenge plot that it so specifically advertised and went more towards the justice route, whereas the film stuck firmly with the revenge plot, which made for a much more exciting and satisfying third act that truly made the film a great story of revenge! In addition to this, everything about this film was absolutely perfect and phenomenal! The gorgeous cinematography and landscape shots throughout, the hauntingly effective and powerful score, the brutal and unflinching violence and action, etc. And of course, the acting from everyone involved was outstanding! Leonardo DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar for this film, mark my words!!! Tom Hardy also delivers a very aggressive performance. Even Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter make the most of their characters and screentime. So overall, director Alejandro G. Inarritu does it again with a film that's just as intriguing and engaging as his last film Birdman was!

Before the end of an era, he learns the meaning of family and being a hero for others. I know this may sound far-fetch, but I would go as far to say that Jackman deserves some award buzz for this. The raw emotion he brought to his scenes without any sloppy music under neath it, is achievement.

So music like this fits perfectly and I'm glad it didn't go for a terrible R&B song for once."", ""The writing is just top-notch and if you're an inspired writer, you should take notes from this.

It starts off with Chiron as a shy child living in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami with his crack addict mother. This leads to him meeting Juan (Mahershala Ali), which leads to him taking a lot from him (appearance wise) when an adult. Him being bulled at school leads to him being buffed, strong, and confident so none can pick on him ever again. But at the same time, he's hiding himself even more by being something that he's not. He acts gangster and talks in a American slang that I bet he doesn't fully understand. You can say different arguments to this, but how I see it, he's just getting better at hiding of who he really is. It's are journey through life that defines us as human beings.

The thing I love about this movie is that the romance didn't feel force or cliche. The one thing I can't stand in romance movies is where the two lovers talk about how much they love each other and why they love each other, I mean screenwriting like that is just the worse, but Carol avoids all that and goes for a creative way of showing the romance that's best to be seen and felt. There's a scene in this movie that's personally my favorite scene of this year so far, and that's when the two of them are in the car going through a highway tunnel. Then we get to see Rooney Mara character (Therese) point of view as she looks at Carol and you as an audience member get to see what makes Carol so special in Therese's eyes.

The plot develops very well as the movie deals with a lot of rather serious issues for a comic book adaptation and tackles a detail that I never fully stopped to consider before: the collateral damage and after-effects of all-out war. The public image of The Avengers is questioned heavily as the world attempts to have some say in how superhumans operate and serve in the defense of mankind. It's these much more mature themes that lend a lot of quality to Civil War. Equally impressive is the director's ability to have so much star power/super heroes on screen at once and never feel like any of it's over-gratuitous. It all makes for a great blend of action, fun and story development. While Chris Evans' Captain America is meant to be the primary focus in this adventure, it's the multitude of other characters that really help this movie shine brighter than even The Winter Soldier. Marvel/Disney have yet another winning movie adaptation on its hands and leaves a lot to be excited about over the eventual Avengers 3 two-part, sort-of finale to this part of the Marvel universe (at least, the assumed end as Disney/Marvel haven't signed the main actors beyond the next Avengers movie)."" ]";3;8;3;5;1;0.125

Wall Street is complex to the typical person, I followed it but only just barely.  Seeing several of the storylines that lead into one of the largest economical collapses of America is both incredible and worrisome.  To see so many professionals injecting so much convolution into the properties market on the back-end really makes you wonder how we managed to go so long without having a collapse sooner.  But this all happened and, in cases where applicable, the cast breaks that \""fourth wall\"" to explain what's going on and if something absurd on screen actually happened (in most cases the answer is \""yes this actually happened\"", or \""we're lead to believe this happened\"").  Every actor in this movie turns in a solid performance, but I have to give a lot of credit to Steve Carrel for shining brightest in The Big Short.  He delivers with an incredible amount of conviction, as if he were actually in charge of an investment firm that just discovered the bedrock of America's economy were about to collapse.  It's all brilliant stuff, and the fact that it's true, or mostly-true, might make your jaw drop a little bit.  If you're into the business/finance world, this will be even more enjoyable for you, since the terminology which is only explained in small summations will be received like this was all everyday English.  If you can truly say to yourself \""I have a hard time following complex movie plots\"", this will be a bit of an exercise.

It stars Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay who, at 69 and 78, respectively, play the parts of Geoff and Kate Mercer, a supposedly happily married couple as they, or more properly, Kate, plans their 45th Wedding Anniversary celebration at the local banquet hall. Spanning a period of less than a week in their lives, this is the story of a long lost romance Geoff had well before he ever met Kate and how this 50 year old experience suddenly impacts on their present lives and, more significantly, Kate’s reaction and response to what she now learns about it. Mr. Courtenay plays a subdued and stoic role as he attempts to move on from the past while Ms. Rampling’s character becomes more absorbed with the historic details as if this now deceased part of her husband’s life is still alive and in competition with her. Enough cannot be said of the wonderful acting of Ms. Rampling who, with little or no dialogue, is able to express more emotion and feeling than most actors might if they were shouting. Although the film is long and at times somewhat tedious, it is in effect mirroring the relationship of the couple on the screen as they, in their typical British civility, struggle through the emotional obstacles that confront them. I give the film a 0 rating and credit Mr. Haigh with successfully accomplishing the dual role of good writing and directing."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0.125

It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to \""bring out the best\"" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it’s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art.

This is Mr. Miyazaki’s last animated film and, indeed, the filmgoing community is the lesser for it. The graphics contained in this film are breathtaking and as beautiful to view as one can imagine. The film tells the life story of one of the world’s greatest aircraft engineers, Jiro Hurikushi, as it follows his career as a near sighted boy who dreams of flying but, because of his poor eyesight, is forced to vicariously enjoy his passion by designing airplanes instead, The film chronicles Mr. Hurikushi’s life through Japan’s great earthquake in the early 20th Century, the massive tuberculosis epidemic and its great depression and is as enlightening as it is entertaining. The film is offered on two different screens, one with the original dialogue (with English subtitles) and the other with the English dubbed in. See the technically perfect dubbed in version with actor Joseph Gordon-Lewitt as Jiro and Emily Blunt as Naoko, the love of his life. The movie comes as near to perfect as possible but for one problem. It is too long and looking at my watch during the approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes was a distraction. As has so often been said, when the writer also assumes the role of director, it is like a parent trying to edit out the performances of his children….a difficult task that requires more objectivity than dedication and proves that too much of a good thing necessarily isn’t.  With all of that being said, the film is nevertheless a lovely theatrical viewing experience and one that will be as enjoyable for its adult audience to see as it will be for the children who accompany them. I give the film a rating of 9 as  this cinematic endeavor, like the wind in the title, will take the viewer to new and exciting heights.

After all, the film experience should be pleasurable and something to enjoy. Nevertheless, I took the opportunity to view the film on a DVD a friend generously loaned to us. As I watched the film my concerns were indeed realized for some of the scenes were certainly uncomfortable to watch. However It was worth the 10 or 15 total minutes of discomfort to be able to be artistically exhilarated as we saw inhumanity and dignity oppose each other in what was the then mentality and norm of the slave genre and the society that embraced it. The acting of Chiwitel Ejifor, the writing of John Ridley and the direction of Steve McQueen make this a rewarding theatrical experience which the viewer will find difficult to forget or even equal. The film tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a cultured and well respected African American northerner, who is kidnapped and then sold into slavery by his abductors and ends up spending 12 years on one or more southern plantations. It’s easy for an audience member, black or white, to identify with the lead character and that is what makes the film work so well.  Massive suffering among thousands is a broad and almost meaningless phrase when compared to describing the plight of one individual. It is something the viewer can more readily identify with and understand. I give this film a 9. To those who may still be reluctant to see it, think of it as historical medicine.

To my pleasant surprise, my flexibility in viewing choices turned out to be one of the best movie decisions I ever made.

True, the idea of watching family members grow over the years is not especially new except that other projects used different actors to play the same people in different stages of their respective lives. Here, we see the aging of the same actors, not only of the children, but of the parents and other adults as well, as they meet and deal with the various problems that befall them."", ""An unexpected result of having the same actors throughout is that it gives the film a legitimacy and authenticity even though it is a work of fiction."", ""One marvels at the logistical problems that could have occurred had one or more of the four principal cast members passed away or suffered significant life changes during this 12 year filming span (not to mention coordinating the professional availability of all or any of them throughout this over a decade shoot).

While it is uncertain if future films will live up to the awesomness of this one for now we have a great start to what looks to be a promising future."" ]";11;53;11;42;1;0.125
interstellar;9;jesse250;/user/jesse250;Nov 11, 2014;"[ ""The plot holes I looked past, the dialogue was cheesy, but all in all this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. A serious 2001 vibe was felt throughout the theater, but it was different enough to be called its own. The only real gripe, which I CANNOT look past is the loud music during dialogue. REALLY? I mean, it's a fantastic soundtrack, but it's kind of hard to be in the moment when you can't even hear the characters' emotions!! The best example I can give *MAJOR **** SPOILER AHEAD* was when Dr. Brann (Brann? Brand? I don't **** know) died. the dialogue made by him was ACTUALLY IMPORTANT but INSANELY hard to hear due to the music. The creators said it was because they wanted to make the emotions clear not through dialogue, but through the music. Sensible, but STILL, as I've already said, I CAN'T FEEL EMPATHETIC WHEN I CAN'T HEAR WHAT I NEED TO BE EMPATHETIC ABOUT. That's the only gripe I have with this movie, other than a few obvious creative license uses like *SORT OF SPOILER AHEAD* someone surviving going through a black hole when they should have been crushed due to the gravity. In addition the CGI was STUPENDOUS. It really felt like it was actually filmed, not CGI'ed. On top of that, they hired a real astrophysicist to develop an engine to accurately represent a black hole or wormhole. That takes some serious dedication. All in all, if you haven't seen any other movie this year, see this one. 9/10."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0.125

It is beautiful because not everything leads to war and practically all the answers are with a language expert.

Another great choice was addressing the main conflict from multiple points of view, but keeping doctor Banks in the spotlight, with her own conflicts and the way she embraces this new communication style. One big problem was the way in which it is revealed the gift that learning the language gives, both in book and film are forcibly explicit.

The construction sequence of the movie is very coherent to the developed theme, and it is understandable when the gift is acknowledged. Here Amy Adams consecrates herself within the great actresses of cinema; the rest of the cast is pretty good too. Strong direction, bold script and unsettling score of Johann Johannsson.

In addition to Victor, there is Elsa (animated Winona Ryder), Mr. Rzykruski (animated Vincent Price), Edgar, Weird Girl, Toshiaki, Bob and Nassor; all these characters are very well physically constructed and have a defined personality. Second, the vision of the science that brings Tim Burton to the plot is awesome, and it is defined by two things that are said by Mr. Rzykruski: people like what science gives them but not the questions that science asks; and, science is not good or bad, but it can be used in both ways. Third, the idea of gothic mixed with science gives the film a fresh air and it is reflected in the moment when the other boys have their experiments. The thing here is that with these series of creatures, we notice the different approaches to science: love of Victor, ignorance of Edgar, over-confidence of Toshiaki, superiority of Nassor, fear of Bob and accident of Weird Girl. Other great things on this movie are the use of Frankenstein elements and the outstanding application of camera, in the picture are noticeable transitions from one images to another, flip over (360 turn) and the famous vertigo effect, formed by simultaneously dolly in and zoom out.

The director also apply small camera shots and low lighting, in order to demonstrate in a better way the emotions of the characters and the cruelty of the reality. The idea of the story is to exhibit Ali, a man that suddenly becomes in charge of his son, but the thing is that he does not know how to do it. When he or his son gets hungry, he looks for food scraps or steals from a store. If he needs money, he works in whatever it takes, no matter if other people get hurt. And when he is angry or stressed, he goes to a fight club. The protagonist is like an animal, does what he wants when he wants. So out of nowhere, he meets Stephanie, a killer whale trainer. And as the same as her whales, she will train Ali to face the world correctly. That is why he is rust, like a metal that cannot withstand the environment. And he needs to become bone, like Stephanie, that resists every obstacle in life.

The next work of Christopher  Nolan arrives with much more strength than Inception, not only because we  jump from dreams to space, but also because is noticeable the consolidation  that reached this director. First is the setting of the story, the life of  mankind in the Earth has come to an end, although the interesting thing is  how Nolan shows it, from the point of view of a family. Here it is clear  the importance that acquires the human side in the story (which is also  present in Nolan's filmography), and this theme from the beginning to the  end is the protagonist. Some examples are the decision that Cooper has to  make, whether going to space but miss seeing his children grow or stay; and  the other one is probably the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, when  the protagonist sees the compilation video (astonishing performance btw).  This whole thing aims to evaluate human behavior, sometimes subconsciously  (Inception, Memento) and others rationally (Interstellar), but both about  survival instincts. Another amazing things about the picture are: the  visual effects, obviously, how the crew gather the current info and  theories about the aspect of a real dark hole; second, how it exhibits the  concept of relativity; and finally, the representation of time as a  tangible dimension.

Not in a bad sense mind you, but more in the way that the movie intersperses impressive moments with lesser ones. Overall I was amused by Constantine as he is portrayed by Keanu Reeves: a chain smoking film noiresque anti-hero whose has the gift to send demons back home: back from where they come: Mexico.. eh Hell. He reminds me a bit of Rick Deckard as played by Harrison Ford in Blade Runner  in the way he seems like the same kind of a loner, more prone to silence than chatting and possessed with unique skills or powers in the case of Constantine."", """", ""Here however the two deviate in what I find the lesser -Constantine- and the better one -Deckard -. While the latter has skills, but otherwise isn't really different that you and me, the first is special because he has unique gifts. This is is because Constantine is another one of those marvel heroes bestowed with special powers. Something that seems to intrigue the American mind to the point of bafflement. For a country that so advocates the idea of being able to make oneself: from rags to riches they are oddly fascinated by people inflicted or blessed with supernatural powers by birth. While these two angles seem to be in opposition, one is achieved, the other 'bestowed' it really isn't in the result: either way the person involved soars above the humdrum of the grey unremarkable masses of people. It is something intrinsic in the culture I guess."", """", ""The movie makes sure that we never get bored. There is a lot going on although in the rush they kind of forget to develop the tale well. It almost feels like someone took a stack of dc novels and cut out the best parts and turned them into scenes. So it feels like the movie jumps from one scene to the next without slowing down to establish character or take a breath. This jumble of, granted otherwise cool images, makes the movie sometimes laden with scenes that feel superfluous and feels unfocused. There are lots of scenes around the guy who picks up the spear of destiny, an important object in the story, and who makes his way to an unknown destination wreaking havoc on the way.  It is almost glued onto the movie as an afterthought and the guy who picks up the spear is a total nonentity. He isn't even given a single line of text but gets a lot of screentime."", """", ""The mix of better and lesser parts is also visible in the way the camera is handled. At times there are cools shots one of which is where the camera looks down on Reeves and LaBeouf exiting a building and pausing for a short moment in the most left of the screen in front of the doors so Reeves can light a cigarette. The next shot however is a run of the mill  wide shot. And then we switch to the topshot again when Reeves smokes."", """", ""This messiness can also be seen in the cast.

For Maleficent keeps track of her cursed victim, who grows up to be a lovely young woman. It puts her in a dubious position because to fulfill the curse the girl has to survive  dangers and therefore she feels the need to rescue her unaware and unwanted charge. And thus the wicked witch thaws towards the girl."", ""But  alas the curse can not be denied and inevitably the tale proceeds towards it's predicated ending.

You probably see the twist at then coming from miles away, but I still find it a nice one and for once: what does it matter. This is a fairy tale and a lovely story."", """", ""However I admit that there are some things wrong with the movie. For instance, instead of explaining the actions of  an 'evil' person, the 'evilness' attributed to Maleficent is in essence shifted on the shoulders of  king Stefan.

And their fight does not end with the last of the debates. Instead in extends up to the death of the two into the 21st century. The distaste and hatred that isolates influential groups do nothing to make that country more stable. It would go a bit too far to state that this debate is the root of all evil , but it shows for the public eye something that was already in the make: the rising antagonism between (neo)conservatives and progressives that hijacks a nation. As the documentary has it: coming into being are two worlds that hardly communicate."", """", ""It is hard to judge if the documentary is biased, but it states, and this is impression I got, that Vidal went into the debates with the sole intent to tear down Buckley and what he stands for. Buckley seems to have had less of a purpose, but he quickly geared up. Yet I got the impression that Buckley was more honest and more personally affected by these discussions than Vidal was. The latter struck me as a cold calculating bastard to be honest.  But maybe this is because Buckley seemed far more charming than Vidal was."", ""It is sad to know that one man can hate another so much as to state the fact in the public eye. And it is sad that to see how people lap this up."", """", ""And this is probably the weakest part of the documentary. It doesn't tell us much about the fanning of the hatred. It never tells us that nobody had the decency to tell them to stop or that ABC gloated because of soaring numbers of viewers. The documentary basically forgets about those large masses who were drooling over this live soap, foreshadowing the downfall of television as a serious means to inform and educate a nation. For when ABC got the most viewers with their entertainment,  the other networks, with their boring serious distant coverage of the conventions lost theirs. And they saw what was happening and adapted."", """", ""The documentary is one of the best I  haves seen and therefore quite unsettling. It not only concentrates on the debates themselves but glances at what happened before and how Vidal and Buckley fared after and gives us an impression of the participants.

Are we in a room without windows and the only connection to the rest of the world is a television; a one way communication device that isn't even a reliable representation of the world? The television is a place of wonder for Jack and Ma has to explain to him that some things are real(which Jack seems to find strange) and some are not(which he finds to strange as well). The world is larger than Room, but Jack has a hard time to believe it. The metaphor creeps up again when the subject of suicide crops up. Did ma not consider it? Is the Room life from which we can escape by committing suicide? Neither the metaphor nor suicide are addressed.

The deepest despair is not shown at all. As example above '1984' - gives more bright emotion which was in human's mind. Ukraine story of 1920-1991 is a story of nation defeated by tyrants and silent for centuries. People fought, suffered and died - unknown and futile victims. Their stories were never told to the world. The horrors of Russian occupation was so terrible - that hundred years after they are still forbidden for World to know. There was countless millions of Ukrainians who was always ahead in struggle for freedom, but envy of historical neighbors have neither gave real support, nor even allow to tell about Ukrainian identity. This despair is in the basis of national Hymn and ideology - to survive, to live through defeat and hatred toward you.

The main part is that despite drawbacks described above movie opens the topic for discussion and further work. It is absolutely sure it cannot be done without knowing the Ukraine, living here and knowing our live histories. This topic is of utmost importance as even now in 2017 Russian Federation does the same things they did fir centuries: they enslave. kill and LIE.

Showing this to the world is of utmost importance for history and humankind. This is the first step into unknown and George Mendeluk has courage to do that – so he deserves respect and honor.

Either you love it or hate it, but it comes every year.  One movie that didn’t receive any recognition is a movie called “John Wick” starring Keanu Reeves. John Wick was a stylized action movie that was unique enough to warrant high praise like an Oscar nomination. This beautifully choreographed action movie with Reeves shooting his way through the Russian mob. However, the movie has only received minor praise by winning some rewards and nominations. While getting snubbed from all major award ceremonies. However, John Wick should be considered on that top tier of movies in 2014."", ""This Chad Stahelski directed film is set in New York and came out last October. It’s Stahelski’s first major film and Reeves comeback movie. Besides “47 Ronin” it has been 6 years since Reeves stared in a major motion picture. It hasn’t been since 2003’s “Matrix Reloaded” that he’s stared in a movie that got positive ratings from critics. Reeves has also accumulated six Golden Raspberry Awards or Razzies for short. The Razzies is an awards ceremony that gives awards for the worst in film. The movie has earned Reeves some critical praise for his portrayal of the mob hit man."", ""The movie centers around a man named John Wick (Keanu Reeves). It begins with his wife (played by Bridget Moynahan) who had just died from an undisclosed illness. Wick had just settled down after getting out of hitman business. His last link to a normal life was just taken from him. His wife has one last gift for and it’s in the form of a puppy. John Wick has felt a short of comfort in the fact that a piece of his wife is with him and he now has a companion. Makes his loneliness bearable."", ""Unfortunate events lead to the house being broken into, the car stolen, and the dog killed. Set on revenge, John Wick tries to find the men who did it. Wick discovers from a friend that the son (Alfie Allen) of the Russian mob boss (Michael Nyqvist) was involved. Wick is ultimately pulled into the life that he tried so hard to get away from. This sends him down a tale of revenge and despair. Wick tries to seek revenge for the last thing in his life that he held dear to his heart."", ""John Wick is ultimately an action movies. This doesn’t hurt the movie at all, as the movie gets A in every category. The movie is a beautiful display of camera perfection. The cinematography is what sets it apart from most movies these days.  Everything has this blue colorful tone around the lens. The camera gives colorful detail and Johnathan Sela. (Cinematographer) dominates at his craft. This camera allows the subtleness of Stahelski direction allows the movie to shine."", ""Though the best part is both the dialogue and the acting. Keanu Reeves history doesn’t affect his fantastic work in this movie. Delivering a performance that could rival Bruce Willis in the movie “Die Hard”. His diameter is very subtle like the movie is trying to be. He delivers the splendid dialogue like it comes out naturally. “People keep asking if I’m back, yeah I’m think I’m back!” The realistic and phenomenal performances leave the audiences wanting more."", ""Overall, “John Wick” might have some action clichés.

Here's a fact for ya!: Kirsten Wiig almost starred in the film as \""Joy\"" but Lawrence took her place. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Joy Mangano she is the only sensible person in the family, so she's been running around the household most of her life. Things are now complicated, her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) moves backs in to her house after his second marriage has failed, her mom Terry (Virginia Madsen) who is obsessed over soap-operas and watches TV non stop. Joy's ex husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) lives in the basement pursuing his favorite dream about being a musician, Joy's sister (Dascha  Polanco) who undermines everything she does.

Linklater and Krizan create these characters that are spellbinding, Hawke and Delpy bring so much elegance into their characters that’s awe-inspiring also beyond spectacular. On his way to Vienna, an American named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a student returning to Paris. After a prolonged conversations a connection starts between them, Jesse convinces Celine to get of the train with him in Vienna and start a journey. Jesse’s flight doesn’t depart till tomorrow, so he has no money for lodging. They wander off in the city sharing experiences with one and another.

I don't care if people think Reeves is a bad actor, to be honest he's like able but this guy is trying to make his character awesome, likeable and to root for while he proves he's a physical actor, which makes the action more better. Laurence Fishburne as the leader is the best leader in the film, he awnsers all the questions that audiences have, he's something people need while watching the film. Writen and directed by the Wachowski brothers, they put so much detail in their marvel script and if there's one thing that they achieve in directing their action block busters is understanding the art of an action scene.

The ruthlessness of these drug lords is unquestioned, a point evidenced through scenes of mutilated bodies hung from ropes beneath city bridges in Juarez, Mexico, and further driven home when Del Torro suggests to Blunt that the victims probably didn’t even do anything wrong, the drug lords simply want people to know that this is what happens to you if you do something they don’t like.  Juarez, which is just across the border from El Paso, is one of the deadliest cities in the world."", ""The story is a twist on a couple of old tropes.

She’s neither a new agent, nor a jaded veteran.   She’s been exposed to some hard core violence and death, and she’s performed well, but she’s not a fully seasoned veteran."", ""After joining Brolin’s team, it quickly becomes clear that Blunt is in way over her head.  In addition, she strongly objects to the methodology employed by Brolin as being both illegal and immoral.  (If your enemy is helpless and you kill him, are you any better than your enemy?)"", ""The film maker wants you to agonize over is whether Blunt is right or wrong in her convictions.   As if to further inflame the tension, the movie pits masculine against feminine.  Blunt is the only female in the group.

It weaves universally-appealing themes of community, love, and perseverance into a superbly structured narrative that is as all-encompassing in terms of perspective as it is in scale and time. This is, all at once, a pulse-pounding thriller that showcases the valiant efforts of the authorities involved, an inspiring tear-jerker about how a community can learn to heal in the face of such tremendous adversity, and a chilling cautionary tale about the dangers of extremist thinking and indoctrination of any form.

However, it's Heath's performance that still reigns surpeme in this film overall. He and Nolan not only created an Oscar-Winning character, but a character that has had a pretty deep impact on pop culture. Aaron Eckhart did a good job as the tragic Harvey Dent character. All of the other actors were fantastic as well - including Bale's continually impressive Bruce Wayne/Batman performance.

The film stars Matt Damon and starts up where the previous film (\""The Bourne Supremacy\"") left off. To start off, \""Ultimatum\"" had big shoes to fill - \""Identity\"" set the proverbial bar for the franchise and \""Supremacy\"" raised this bar. Does \""Ultimatum\"" live up to the expectations that it was assigned? In short. . .yeah. . .yeah it does. \""Ultimatum\"" is an expertly crafted film that takes every facet of the first two films and elevates them to an exponential degree. I honestly did not believe the claim that these movies got better with each installment. But, hey, seeing is believing I guess. Just when I thought that Matt Damon's portrayal of Bourne was multifaceted enough, he adds more complicated and compelling layers to this character in \""Ultimatum\"" - I mean, layers upon layers of Bourne are presented throughout this film. If you thought that you had gained a strong emotional attachment to Bourne via the first two movies, well see the third because Damon just blasts expectations with this performance. This performance and the overall film as a whole, is built up by the brilliantly written screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This script is the fulcrum of the film. It's brisk dialogue and precious I-Can't-Believe-That-Just-Happened moments make the film that much more amusing as a whole. One of my favorite aspects of the entire Bourne franchise is the score. Whether it's John Powell's fast-paced music or Moby's stylish trademark song \""Extreme Ways\"", the recurring musical elements really help to embed the film into the audience's head. Paul Greengrass' impressive direction is once again a masterstroke aspect of this film's massive appeal.

As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved \""Man On Fire\"" and \""Unstoppable.\"" However, movies like \""Deja Vu\"" and \""The Taking Of Pelham 123\"" are just sort of \""meh\"" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in \""Top Gun,\"" \""True Romance,\"" and \""Crimson Tide\"") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in \""Deja Vu,\"" \""Man On Fire,\"" and \""Unstoppable\""). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. \""Crimson Tide\"" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything \""The Hunt For Red October\"" had, yet there was just a tad more. While \""The Hunt For Red October\"" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, \""Crimson Tide\"" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly.

After watching \""Casino Royale\"" I can safely say that this film effectively restores the Bond film series, as well as the James Bond name, to everything that author Ian Fleming had originally intended. This film features one of the most dynamic portrayals of the character I've ever seen on film. Sure, everything from the previous films is there (the charm, wit, etc.), but Actor Daniel Craig brings some aspects to the character I've never seen before. He does a really profound job at accentuating just how much of a cold bastard 007 really is. Though he also does a good job at depicting the more loving side of Bond -like I said. . .dynamic. With all these different shades of Bond in tow, Craig creates, quite possibly, my favorite representation of the character. Eva Green does a fine job in her role as the beguiling treasury agent, Vesper Lynd. Green and Craig construct a deep kind of chemistry that I have yet to see any other Bond and \""Bond-girl\"" develop on film. Also, cheers to Mads Mikkelson for playing one of the creepiest Bond-villains I've ever seen. In terms of technicalities, The camerawork is very clean, and editing is logical and accurate. The soundtrack utilizes the classic Bond Theme, but it also employs some extra nuances that I found to be quite suitable for the overall tone of the film. The screenplay is very well written, giving Bond some of the funniest lines I've ever heard his character say. The action is there too, as this movie features some of the coolest and most intimidating set pieces I've seen on film.

Now, I know that some people claim that movie bastardizes the book because it's not told from the perspective of another character in the film. However, the movie still effectively presents the themes that are communicated in the novel, and it still makes a meaningful attempt at trying to portray all the events in the novel correctly. \""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\"" was a movie that was ahead of it's time.

In fact, the whole concept of \""Wilson The Volleyball\"" was not conceived until about halfway through shooting. Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue, yet it still remains highly entertaining experience. Much of the film's complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland, a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves. Which leads me to another point, and, possibly, my favorite aspects of \""Cast Away\"" - the themes conveyed. The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing, but that shouldn't stop us from pursuing something better. This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie, the movie's main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film.

Now, I know that the first mention of the name \""Shyamalan\"" nowadays leads many people to think, \"". . .ew 'The Last Airbender' \"". However, there was a time when Shyamalan actually made pretty good movies. This, thankfully, is one of the only 3 he has made. \""Unbreakable\"" is a truly compelling study of the narrative mechanics of comic books. I, being a big nerd who loves comic books, found this movie to be intensely interesting to watch because it clued me into things which I didn't know about them. Like the fact that a villains eyes are always portrayed to slightly bigger than the hero's because it shows that his view on the world is slightly more off-kilter than the hero's. And the fact that the hero's origin is often tied/interconnected with the villain's origin. These are just two of the many interesting concepts of comic book writing that are discussed throughout \""Unbreakable\"". Now make no mistake - this movie isn't a documentary. Yes, it does discuss a lot of the methods comic book writers utilize to convey their very distinct messages, but it does this verbally and nonverbally. This movie maintains a very quiet, yet intensely brooding tone. This tone is amplified by the really somber and mesmerizing performance from Bruce Willis. The cinematography is really intelligently executed, as I found myself saying, \""oh that was pretty cool/clever\"", to a very large amount of this film's shots.

He, in turn, forms a 'fight club' with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make \""Fight Club\"" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic. As for direction, David Fincher is . . . .well he's David Fincher. The guy really knows how to put a film together.

However, while the screenplay is decidedly impressive, the most imposing aspect of this film is the performances within it.

the-grey;10;Compi24;/user/Compi24;Nov 28, 2012;"[ ""\""The Grey\"" is a 2012 movie directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Liam Neeson. The film is about a oil rigging team that tries to survive the harsh Alaskan wildlife after their plane crashes. Let me start off by saying that Joe Carnahan has been a hit or miss director for me. He usually specializes in high octane and stylized action flicks. Movies like \""The A-Team\"", and \""Smokin' Aces\"" look cool, but they fail to impress me on an intellectual level. Now, here we have \""The Grey\"". This movie is a departure from Joe Carnahan's style. . .in a good way. This movie is toned down to a much more believable level and it has substance. A great script that has not only great dialogue and characters, but this movie's script possesses very deep philosophical and poignant moments. I walked into this film feeling that my heart strings wouldn't be threatened. This movie tugged at them up a great deal. Liam Neeson gives the best performance I've ever seen him give. I honestly thought that Neeson would be the typical badarse he's been fond of playing as of late, but his character (and all of the other as well) is so multi-dimensional, complex, and most importantly, real. The soundtrack is as touching as it is chilling. Joe Carnahan proved me wrong. This movie is a phenomenally entertaining, moving, thrilling piece of cinema. I implore everyone to go see it."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0.1111111111111111

This isn't just your average horror movie, though. No, no. In fact, in many ways it falls short of the simple identifiers that help sell modern horror pictures in general. Supernatural elements? Nope. Found footage element? Not even. Jump scares galore? Think again. This is an inventive, accessible, painful, stick-to-your-ribs horror film that hearkens back to - yes, I know, but bear with me here - other twisted, psychologically-fuelled horror classics like \""Psycho\"" and \""The Silence Of The Lambs,\"" and it is without a doubt one of the most entertaining times I've had at the theater in recent memory. This is a film that has not only seen every horror movie known to man, but is well aware of the fact that you have too. \""Don't Breathe\"" takes a look at all the expectations, cliches, and tropes that we've gleaned from these horror films, spits on them, cusses at them, and flips the table on them. There is nearly nothing predictable about \""Don't Breathe.\"" And THAT is where the true horror comes in."", ""There's a certain point within the film (I'd say right around the twenty-minute mark) where you as a viewer are forced to take a step back and realize that you have absolutely no idea where this story is headed and that you are utterly powerless in the journey that is about to ensue. And that helplessness, that lack of certainty in what's about to happen; THAT's what makes this movie scary. Sure, the lead performance from Stephen Lang is truly menacing and a career best. Indeed, the set design and makeup effects evoke nausea and other forms of discomfort. Of course the darkness of the story at hand (both real and metaphorical) is spooky to think about. But I say again - knowing that director Fede Alvarez is deliberately misdirecting you at every turn? THAT's horrifying. I surrendered to \""Don't Breathe\"" and, as a result, I was able to enjoy what has quite easily become my favorite modern horror film to date."", ""In contrast to this film's title, I'd advise you guys to - y'know - always breathe.

The love story dealing with Affleck's character and a hostage actually gives the movie more meaning instead of making it feel cheezy, which is a hard thing to do but it still slows down the pacing too much.  The action scenes are done with vigor and energy, which is refreshing compared to other films' usually flat time fillers.  Where the movie does fall kind of short is in its formulaic one last job scenario.  The screenplay is actually extremely well written and full of fiery dialogue exchanges and desperate situations, but it's all set in a limited frame.  I let Inception slide with its one last job cleche because it was so innovative in other areas and not affected or limited by that plot point at all.

Unlike most of his roles Denzel Washington's Alonzo Harris is an absolute monster.  Cruel, violent, deceitful, and downright nasty, he makes other loose cannon cops like John McClane seem like SpongeBob in the episode where he becomes a hall-monitor.  Denzel rightfully earned an Oscar in this role.  Dafoe also does a great job, which earned him an Oscar nomination as well.  This movie is a gritty, exhilarating, and extremely well crafted thrill ride.  There are plot twists and turns you won't expect, as well as lots of memorable dialogue and action.  Corruption and morally ambiguous situations literally stuff the film, which makes it as thought provoking as it is visceral.  Near the ending there is a generic and basically pointless chase scene which took up enough time to force me into giving it an 8 instead of a nine, but don't let this quibble discourage you from seeing it.

It has a twist ending that descends the story into complete, albeit entertaining, stupidity, it packs on way too much sexually immoral content, and lacks any true meaning despite its constant insistence that it does.  It also slows down too much during some sections.  These flaws would normally sink a movie's score a lot further down and even kill some outright, but Fight club is so entertaining in a hyper macho off kilter sort of way, so well made, and so memorable in ways that few movies can ever achieve that in the end they're not detrimental to the film's overall quality.

Other than some minor gripes however, this is still one heck of a movie.  It's all enveloped in an eerie atmosphere unlike anything else out there.  Much of this comes from the visual decisions.  The art direction is superbly gothic and near non-stop rain plights the futuristic city of L.A. for almost the entire movie.  The action is also unique in that it possesses a cold, strange, and gritty aesthetic, most evidently seen in the scene where Decker is being hunted by the lead replicant inside of the abandoned building.  There are also scenes of emotional intensity here, mostly related to the replicants' yearning for a less abbreviated life.  It's not as tightly directed as Scott's other sci-fi classic Alien, but what is?  It makes up for this by tackling much more ambitious thematic content than that movie.

While the movie is extremely well acted and decently unique it still lacks the weight to be a masterpiece, but I'm not exactly sure why.  The fault may lie in its futuristic world.

The thing I can't quite get past is the lingering youth novel adaptation feel to the movie which it can't completely shake off, even though you can tell that it badly wants to.  It's somewhat hard to explain, but you can still tell that it's aimed at older teens and not adults.  That's not to say that the movie is immature.  In fact its narrative deals with some very mature issues such as fascism, human worth, and rebellion.

She shows"", ""extreme emotion more naturally than she has in the past and proves a great anchor for the franchise.  The new director, Francis Lawrence, who's not related to Jennifer, directs everything a lot more smoothly than Gary Ross, especially the action.  The larger budget also helps.  Instead of merely being passable, the visual effects are now up there with the best of them.  Overall the movie is very engaging and possesses some moments which are truly emotionally stirring, but it still lacks the rapturous grandeur and pure awe of films like Inception and Avatar, and the screenplay, which is good, lacks the precision of films like Zero Dark Thirty, or No Country for Old Men.  But, it's still worth going out to see, and even worth buying once it hits DVD and Blue-Ray.  I think it deserves Oscars, but that prospect is wildly unlikely.

Overall, Elysium isn't able to stand beside Blomkamp's first film, or Inception or Avatar either for that matter, (The trio of great recent sci-fi films released within relatively short time from each other), but it may be the best film of the summer, and that's nothing to cry about.

Unlike The Dark Knight, it is not a genuine crime thriller in the vein of The Departed.  This is because Nolan's direction has went backwards in terms of attention to detail, especially in the action department, and he's added to many far fetched elements, such as Bane being able to punch through walls.  Speaking of Bane, Tom Hardy is a very good villain.  He's very scary, but he still can't match the pure insanity of Ledger.

It may be by my own doing, but my extremely high expectations for this film going in led to a bit of disappointment in some areas. Don't get me wrong, this was easily the best solo Wolverine outing. However, in my opinion, it's far from being the best X-Men film overall (personally, I enjoyed Days of Future Past and Deadpool the most.) Some have even gone as far as to say that this is Marvel's \""The Dark Knight\"", and that it's just as good, if not, better than that film. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say that either unfortunately. Anyway, with all of that out of the way, this was still a solid and entertaining final outing for Wolverine with all of the grittiness and hard violence that the fans had asked for over and over again for the longest time, not unlike last year's \""Deadpool\"" as well (btw, he does have his own humorous little intro at the very beginning of the film.) Hugh Jackman is better than ever, with his portrayal of Wolverine feeling more humanistic and vulnerable than before. Like I said before, the action is top-notch and the violence and blood ever so present like what we had hoped for all this time in a Wolverine film. The film did an excellent job of really getting things interesting and going in the first half with the story and action. However, it's the second half where my disappointment began to settle in, as the story, as well as the final 20-30 minutes in particular began to feel rushed and the ending also felt pretty underwhelming and rushed for me overall. It definitely left me feeling that our silver-clawed friend deserved a much bigger sendoff rather than the underwhelming and rushed one that was given instead. Overall, this was still the best Wolverine film by far, but unfortunately, it didn't quite fully live up to the hype for me and I didn't find myself loving it like I had so hoped. Nevertheless, it's still a very entertaining and action-packed addition to the X-men franchise, and one that allowed Hugh Jackman to give us a well-meaning and powerful final performance in his career-making role."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0.0

It also felt much more intense and gripping, especially during the games. Once again, the cast gave exceptional performances. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was definitely a step up from the first film, as her portrayal of Katniss felt more detailed and compelling to watch. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth also return as Peeta and Gale respectively. There were also some great new additions to the cast. Sam Claflin gave a slick performance as Finnick. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was great as always too! I was also happy to see the very underrated Jena Malone playing Johanna. Overall, it followed the book pretty well. Really, my only issue with this movie was that in some spots, it focused a little too much on the rather cheesy and cliche side plot of the love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta.

The entire all-star cast gives it their all with some great and memorable performances. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a career-defining performance in what is a very emotional and powerful portrayal of Solomon Northrup. Michael Fassbender also gives one of his best performances to date as a cruel plantation owner. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o gives a well done, yet highly overrated performance as a fellow slave. The reason I'm calling it overrated is because she's won and is up for so many awards for a performance that wasn't even that impressive (Jennifer Lawrence did much better in \""American Hustle\"" and certainty deserves the Oscar over Lupita.) Other actors who did really good, but didn't get much screentime include Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, and Brad Pitt. Overall, while Solomon's story feels a little \""been there, done that\"" in terms of slavery, the acting helps push it along nicely. While it's no doubt that it's a great film, I wouldn't consider it best picture material. I'd be OK with it winning however.

However, the film still manages to come up with great and honest new laughs that make up for that. Overall, if you loved or even just enjoyed the first film, this one will likely please you.

I was also glad to see Samuel L. Jackson in this one reprising his Nick Fury role. There were also some good new cast additions, like Robert Redford. Great action sequences, along with a cool new villain really made this a great addition to the series of standalone Avenger films before Avengers 2 hits theaters next year.

Not only did Schumer manage to not annoy the crap out of me (for most of it at least), but it also had a lot of really funny moments, great one-liners, and some fun cameos (John Cena, LeBron James, Method Man, even Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei!) In addition, it also had a surprising amount of heart to it, which I certainly wasn't expecting. Overall, depending on your tolerance for rom-coms in general, you may or may not enjoy it.

Andrew Garfield delivers his best performance since his breakout role in The Social Network. As for Michael Shannon, even though I'm used to seeing him typecast as the creepy/shady villain or businessman, he manages to pull it off rather well once again in this film. As for the film itself, it offers a rather poignant story and almost every scene I found rather difficult to watch due to the tone and tension.

Also, the ending was slightly tweaked and added on to, but other than that, the rest of the film was entertaining, Damon gave a confident and often times humorous performance (staying true to the nature of his character in the book), and Scott's direction was superb and a great return to form after some of his previous mediocre films (e.g., The Counselor, Exodus.)

Benedict Cumberbatch also did well as Whitey's younger brother, and I must say that I was rather surprised at how well he was able to pull off a convincing Boston accent with him being a British actor. Other cast members, such as Kevin Bacon, Corey Stoll, etc also gave noteworthy performances. As for the rest of the film, it did feel a little \""been there, done that\"" in terms of gangster and crime films. Then again, I understand it is kind of hard to make films like this stand out, especially since so many of them have taken place in Boston like this film (The Departed, The Town, American Hustle, etc.) But like I said, it's the strong work from the cast that makes the film worth watching, and it is a step above director Scott Cooper's last film Out of the Furnace."" ]";4;6;4;2;0;0.0

In terms of acting, newcomer Sasha Lane gives quite a memorable and honest performance.

Nonetheless, it's still quite a solid, yet a bit more slow burn of a film that maintains the same tense and unpredictable atmosphere. Just as he did with 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', Sheridan brilliantly crafts a screenplay with a gritty and absorbing story and characters, but in addition, this time he even gets in the director's chair for the first time in this one, truly proving his worth and talent as not just a superb storyteller, but filmmaker as well. Rounded out with strong performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and you've got a great thriller with quite a dark, yet compelling story to tell. Overall, like I said before, my only gripe with this one is that it ended up being a bit more subtle and slow burn than I expected, especially compared to 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', but it's still well worth anyone's time who enjoyed those two films or are simply just looking for an all-around great and often times tense film."" ]";1;5;1;4;0;0.0

It succeeds as a comedy but somehow as a drama it doesn't because it's predictable, you know were it's going to go but Crowe wants you forget the cliches and want you to focus more on the characters and the situations their going through and care for them also relate to, he succeeds at that when the cliches start popping back up again it makes you groan and it's just so irritating. Orlando Bloom plays Drew, a shoe designer who is on a flight to Kentucky, where his father died of a heart attack, during a family visit. Kristen Dunst plays Claire Colburn, the only flight attendant who meets Drew on a deserted plan, where he is the only one passenger on that plane. He just wants to be alone.

Drew was about to commit suicide on the death exercise bike machine, when the phone call came in about his father's death. He is a successful young shoe designer of the  Spasmodica shoe, a popular world-wide shoe but a new product that his boss Phil (Alec Baldwin) informs him that he'll lose $972 million. Drew's suicide plan is now going to wait for the visit to Elizabethtown, where his father is related to half of the population and the best friend on the other half. His mom Hollie (Susan Sarandon) is still hated because she took her husband away from his hometown and family to California.

Ultimately, Claire may not only help Drew get through the  arrangements of his father's funereal, but she does provide Drew with a different perspective of his life and drifting him away from his thoughts of suicide. While this movie is a cliche'd drama it does get emotional and works for me, Bloom isn't the great at acting but he's is good at drama and he should be in these roles more often; him and Dunst has decent chemistry on screen which makes the film even more better. It may not be the best film Crowe has ever made and maybe not Oscar \""worthy\"" but it's Golden Globes \""worthy\"" like I said not the best Cameron Crowe movie, but it proves he is one of the best directors.

The Force Awakens is remarkably similar to A New Hope in numerous ways, and while I enjoy both of these movies, The Force Awakens doesn't quite captivate the same way the very first entry into this franchise does.  What this film DOES do well is flash what lies ahead for us - the technical prowess is incredible here. X-Wings in formation striking beachheads or enemies in space are incredible.  Everything George Lucas did through 6 episodes is suddenly garbage in the wake of the Abrams touch.  The new cast is also solid, even if Kylo Ren's character isn't as well explained as I would have liked.  Certain characters and the background story need some work to transcend all the other excellent franchises being iterated on year after year right now.  Star Wars is no longer alone in the sci-fi world, it's merely a cornerstone and The Force Awakens does only enough to remind us of what Star Wars can be, but doesn't fully deliver in its resurgence.  Regardless, this movie was very enjoyable and should please many fans worldwide.  The BEST news is that Star Wars isn't limited to just episodes 7-9 as there are four other side-plot movies in development as well.  So while the core story of this new Star Wars adventure isn't completely built yet (at least, in this movie), these other movies taking the Marvel universe approach could perhaps fill in some of the blanks and keep satiating our appetites for all things Star Wars."" ]";208;266;208;58;0;0.0

I enjoyed the political musical chairs aspect and how things that seem good could be bad and vice versa.  Donald Sutherland again shines as President Snow but his role is always a bit gated in these movies despite being the main villain.  Perhaps my biggest complaint is that, after all of this build up to an assault on the capital, the fight ends somewhat abruptly and without a lot of \""oomph\"", even though there's a couple surprises in those moments.  The time taken on the aftermath is both warranted and a bit drawn out, as if the movie's creators and overseers didn't know how quite to end things on the big screen.  They try to sort everything out when not every little detail must be sorted (or at least with as much emphasis).  Still, Mockingjay Part 2 rallies after its first part clearly cut back on the suspense created by the fantastic Catching Fire.

One might wonder how a film can engender suspense and interest when its outcome is already known to most if not all of its viewers.  “Sully” is a perfect example that such a feat can be accomplshed when there is enough material and good writing to make it happen. Also, like “Sully” the coda at the end of the film introduces us to the real life people who were portrayed in the film which gives glaring reality to the events depicted in it.  I truly enjoyed the film, not only for the good writing and acting , but for the information imparted to the audience as law enforcement worked tirelessy and with speed to end the nightmare that befell the City of Boston. I give the film an 8 rating because, amidst the suffering and tragedy associated with the event, there is also an acknowledgment of the ability of the human spirit to survive and move forward proving once again that “’Boston Strong” was not just a phrase but a fact.."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0.0

I found that the film was too long and draggy and the scenes and chapters did not flow or segue from one to the other in an easy manner. Casting also became an issue but one would have to actually see the film to understand this comment.  Make no mistake, this is a powerful and important film showing the plight that so many lower class youths experience and how their intra-cultural encounters so often shape their low expectancy lives.

Actors don’t speak, they pontificate, and scenes that should be shorter are too long. Poor writing, editing and directing appear to be the culprit causing this film with such a worthy purpose and lofty goal to be less effectual in its execution. Also, what would otherwise have been a great history lesson, especially for those too young at the time to realize the importance of the civil rights struggle in the mid-60’s, is the less than accurate portrayal of key characters, notably President Lyndon. Johnson, whose major claim to fame was his ability to put through the Voting Rights Bill (an effort, history shows, was started weeks before the Selma march).

As good as Mr. Brosnan is in the film, and he is, none of the players can meet or even come near the superb acting talents of Ms. Dyrholm who captures and dominates each scene she is in. The best that can be said of any quality foreign film is that, in recalling it, the viewer forgets that there were subtitles and that a different language was spoken.

It is also the title of the film starring Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford  relating the story of this dynamic ball player from his start with the Kansas City Monarchs through the Montreal Royals until finally, in 1947, signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers and becoming its starting first baseman that season. This is a movie, unlike Django Unchained, which tells the plight, courage and fortitude of one member of a minority and what it took for him to succeed and to become a lone black player amidst major leagues 399 whites. The film, written and directed by Brian Helgeland (“Mystic River”, “Blood Work”, “A Knight’s Tale”) holds the viewer’s interest and attention for all of the 128 minutes of its running time and keeps us involved throughout. For this writer the film was especially meaningful for I lived in the Borough during the time  in which this all took place and, as a young boy, I watched from the Ebbett’s Field bleachers the players on the field as they interacted with this new entry into the ballgame. Jackie Robinson, a four star athlete from UCLA and a commissioned Army officer (court martialed for refusing to move to the back of a bus) was the perfect man to, at 26, enter upon the road to ending the bigotry that was, after all, so much a part of America’s favorite sport at the time. Just as we today cannot imagine women not being able to vote 100 years ago, so difficult is it for us to understand what racism was in the 50’s and how shameful a legacy it left. If there is any difficulty with the film, it is trying to depict its hero.as recognizable but without it being a trite impersonation. Mr. Boseman is not a Robinson look alike yet there are certain times, stances and camera shots that make his portrayal quite believable. Harrison Ford, as Branch Rickey, the managing partner of the group that owned the Dodgers, is a fine addition to the film. Never too overly sentimental, the film does have its “Hollywood moments” but they are few and far between. Suffice it to say that the women and non-baseball fans in the audience seemed to enjoy the film as  much or more than the rest of us. I give this film an 8 and recommend that it be seen by all who have a taste for history and/or a strong liking for baseball. More than anything else it is the story of adversity and how it was met head on by a strong willed and extraordinarily self-controlled individual. The story of this man and who he was can best be summarized by quoting the writer Bob Considine when he wrote “Jackie Robinson was a credit to his race….the human race.”"" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0.0

Written by Aaron Sorkin, the film attempts to tell the story of this genius at helping people communicate with each other through the digital age while himself never quite coming to grips with his own personal demons. The vehicle for the film is the backstage goings on for the 3 launches of Jobs’ products, i.e. the Mac, the NEXT and the iMac. The same drama that precedes the hour or half hour before each launch allows Mr. Sorkin to elicit dialogue from the same five  protagonists  as the audience tries to follow and understand the complexities and inconsistencies of this self acclaimed icon. Similar to last year’s film, \""Birdman\"" (though notably better), the viewer is brought backstage to the inner workings of the presentation process and, through it, the man himself. Based loosely on the Walter Isaacson biography, the film never quite captures the true essence of the man and unfortunately gives us a cleverly written but rather thin  two dimensional look at the lead character. We know as little or less about Mr. Jobs after the film as we did before except that he is or can be arrogrant and callous while himself searching for the humanity that seems to always elude him. Fleeting bits of dialogue thrown in by Mr. Sorkin are apparently intended to give us some insight into the Jobs’ psyche but, unfortunately, they fail to satisfy the viewer’s intellect and curiosity.

This is a story of sadness and a series of ill-fated events that befall Mr.Affleck’s character, Lee Chandler, who is asked to become the guardian of his young nephew upon the sudden death of Lee’s brother Joe. ‘The performances in this film are noteworthy because they are understated yet immensely powerful as each actor communicates great degrees of emotion without overburdening the scenes with wordy laments. Kudos to the young Mr. Hedges who plays Lee’s nephew as he and his uncle Lee attempt to develop a relationship despite different lifestyles and aspirations.

Characters and plot points will be present for a while and then disappear for over an hour. There are a lot of people and places the film needs to cover and while it is all essential, especially in regards to setting up who the prisoners are, it does result in a film that is a tad unfocused and lengthy. So ultimately it comes down to is it worth it. Should Speilberg have taken the time to establish who all the prisoners were so we care about them and its not just some guy that captured at the expense of a flowing narrative. Or should the film have cut down on those sequences streamlining the film but making it a tad harder to connect with the film. There is no easy answer to this question. Nonetheless, Speilberg and the Cohen brothers, who apparently helped write this film, do their best to balance the film and result in something that while not something I’d want to go back and watch again as its not a fun blockbuster is well made and will likely be in the running for the Oscars.

The film is long but it is mostly justified. The only slow part is the first act, which while necessary could’ve been trimmed. Otherwise the film remains intense as you try and figure what will happen and who is lying and who is telling the truth.

This film was able to deliver a tightly written story that was flawlessly paced without sacrificing content from the book, brought out the best of every character, and was really well shot. I often complain that film adaptations of a book rush through their story leaving out various character and plot points well this film doesn’t. I thought that splitting Mockingjay into two movies was a dumb cash grab and that’s probably what Lionsgate thought to but this movie made it work unbelievable well. This is one of the best film adaptations of a book I’ve ever seen. The film stayed true to the book without taking out anything significant and nothing was underdeveloped. The quality of this film makes me wish other film adaptations would follow similar suit and split their books into multiple films as it could lead to better storytelling (ex. the later Harry Potter films). Lionsgate’s financial decision not only has brought them more money but a better story than it would have otherwise. This film reminded me how much I loved the first half of Mockingjay and showed how to make a great adaptation of book. This might be spur of the moment but I might even go so far as to say not only is this the best of the franchise but this is right behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy as one of the best film adaptations of a book ever. This is the third book the one that got weakest reception combine that with threequels tending to suck this film shouldn’t have been this awesome but it was. Well done Lionsgate well done. Curious if Mockingjay Part II will follow similar suit.

Big Hero 6 is a great film that provides Marvel fans, Disney fans, and movie fans in general with a great experience rivaling that of a Pixar film. The supporting characters could use some development but with any luck this film will get a sequel that will explore them even more. Until then I will continue to watch this film as I eagerly await the next Disney film as this studio has regained the magic they had in the 90s. Hopefully Pixar can pick up the slack with Inside Out but regardless its glad to know there is animation studio on top of their game again!

The characters are likeable nothing amazing but I enjoyed them. The presentation is nice but nothing spectacular. What stands out in this movie are three amazing songs the best I’ve heard from Disney in years! I will admit it is not as iconic as The Lion King or Aladdin but hey it is hard to make a masterpiece and for what they did they did a pretty good job. It is hard to take the Disney formula and constantly make it feel fresh and new but they managed. The reason why some people may not like it is because they enjoy other variations of the story. Also, these guys aren’t Pixar nor do they have the original team that did the 90s Disney movies. I will admit it is not Disney’s best but it is still an enjoyable film the best of the year in fact and the best animated film of the year thus far (although The Wind Rises will probably win). If you are a Disney fan you’ll enjoy yourself and if you are along for the ride you’ll get through it ok. As for me this the best of the new age of Disney and it is a shame the film is being marketed as a dumb comedy. It may not be their best but has some great stuff in here that impressed we in ways that Tangled didn’t. Frozen didn’t have the greatest animation or funniest side characters but its story engaged and surprised me and had some fantastic songs and atmosphere. While Pixar’s films have declined in quality (from excellent to good/ok) Disney’s films have gotten better. They aren’t the greatest but it is enjoyable to see it done again and well if I might add.

the-dark-knight;8;Jacob;/user/Jacob;Dec 22, 2012;"[ ""I will admit The Dark Knight is a tough film to get into. The story is complicated especially for a film based on a comic book. The beginning is information overload and could turn some people off. However, once the Joker shows up and chaos ensues the film really picks up. You get into the story, which is great. The film is enhanced by some great performances especially by Heath Leadger. While some of the acting could have been better it is still good and nothing terrible. The story is lengthy and may have benefited from being two films; but it did not bother me as much the second time. The further you get into the film the better it gets. Overall, The Dark Knight is not just a great superhero movie but a great film. It has a deep story, good characters, and some nice filming to top it of. If you have not seen this film yet check it out its great. You do not have to like Batman to enjoy this film. It is an interesting take on some well-known characters and I love it. I enjoyed the Dark Knight a lot the second time around and I am probably going to see it again in the future multiple times."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0.0

The story is predictable but what makes it enjoyable are the characters, the acting, and the relationships (particularly Will’s relationship with Williams’ character as well as his relationship with Ben Affleck’s character). It’s a nice feel good movie. My only issues come from the last third/fourth of the movie where we have to sit through a lot of arguing as well as moping and doping even though its obvious that the film will end on a happy note and what that note will be specifically. Since this is a Robin Williams movie where he plays a teacher that inspires a pupil, I feel its fair to compare it to Dead Poet’s Society, which is a better film. I found the arc of the students’ in that film to be far more interesting and I like how the happy ending comes at the cost of some tragedy. Additionally, that film was not as predictable. With all that said though I still enjoy Good Will Hunting it’s a heart-warming film with a good message that pulls at your heart strings. It makes you laugh and cry as well as remember a time when cell phones did not exist and the Dunkin Donuts logo looked different. It is cliché and predictable but I’m willing to overlook it because the characters are likeable and the relationships are fantastic especially in the first half (second half/third is where the clichés fall in). This is definitely a movie that everyone should see at least once in their life."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

Every problem I have with this film is minor and/or can easily be overlooked. The film has an original concept that leads to some fantastic action scenes and an amazing climax. Leonardo DiCapprio embodies the character he plays to the point when I’m not thinking to myself that’s Leonardo DiCapprio that’s the Inception character. The score and direction are great. Most of the characters don’t have much too them and the score is a little too much like Dark Knight and is overshadowed by the wakeup music but those are issues that I can easily overlook. It is rare that I can just sitback and enjoy a film without thinking of critiques, the score I’ll give it, etc because Inception has microscopic problems. This film is awesome it blew me away and truly ranks as not just a great film for Nolan to add to his resume but one of the greatest films out there. I loved watching this movie and I can’t wait to see it again. With more and more viewings this could become one of my favorite movies. With Nolan having a film this awesome under his belt I cannot wait for Interstellar because films like this prove how awesome of a filmmaker he is.

This is a film that will appeal to both casual movie goers and Star Trek fans alike. If you have not seen the movie yet check it out because I think that you will really like it. Star Trek (2009) is a great film that does a good job setting up the characters and I cannot wait to see what happens to them in Star Trek Into Darkness. When the film ended I wanted to see more of these characters and thankfully after four years of waiting the sequel is finally coming out.

The stand out is the presentation with the film being beautiful to look at and is a must see on the big screen and/or IMAX (definitely IMAX!). Its not as good as The Dark Knight or Inception. The film is a little too long (dragging a lot in the first hour), the ending reveal is a little predictable, and the film doesn’t make you think as much as the others. Honestly, though its still a really good film in what has been for Nolan a great track record. See this movie while its in theaters as this is one you don’t want to miss.

her;9;Axgrinder;/user/Axgrinder;Feb  7, 2014;"[ ""‘Her’ is one of those movies that got snubbed by the 2014 Oscar nominating committee.  The first thought I had after seeing the movie was, “How did Spike Jonze ever think something like that up!”  The material is incredibly original, and it probably should have received a nomination for best original screenplay.  The movie is also well cast. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is first rate.  It’s too bad he doesn’t seem to be well liked by the Hollywood crowd.  While I’m not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, she is quite credible and does an excellent job of expressing emotion as a disembodied voice.  Having recently seen American Hustle I had a hard time getting used to the rather timid character portrayed by Amy Adams.  Though I’m not sure you would call ‘Her’ Best Picture material, it’s a far better movie than Wolf of Wall Street."", """", ""That being said, this movie is not for everyone.  It’s definitely different, but has the potential to become something of a cult classic.  (Think ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, with a more conventional ending).  The movie is set in the near future, but the future is a bit of a sterile, lonely and nerdy place.  People are hesitant.  They don’t interact with each other well, and when they do, their conversations are awkward and their behavior is forced.  (Some reviewers seem to mistake this for bad acting.)  Fashion has also taken a turn for the worse, as people in the future dress badly (especially the men who seem to favor really high-waisted pants)."", """", ""Although the basic premise of the movie “Lonely man falls in love with the voice on his operating system” sounds a bit creepy, and might have been if Jonze hadn’t done such an excellent job, the movie really isn’t the least bit so.  The ‘sex’ in this movie is of a variety that is intended to make you a bit uncomfortable.  There is only a brief bit of traditional (gratuitous?) female nudity, and no traditional action scenes, which again may discourage the average viewer. But, if you are still reading this, then don’t be discouraged about seeing it, it’s a terrific movie.  It’s a story about loneliness.  It’s about the basic need for companionship, the struggle to fulfill that need, and the mistakes we make along the way.

wild;9;Axgrinder;/user/Axgrinder;Dec 20, 2014;"[ ""This is Resse Witherspoon at her best.  Despite the fact that Witherspoon spends most of the movie without traditional make-up her personality shines through.  The majority of the scenes involve Witherspoon by herself so if you didn’t like Gravity because the film centered on Sandra Bullock then you may not like this flick either.  The movie is based on the true story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman unable to cope with her own life.  Weighed down with frustration and grief from the death of her sweet, but white trash, mother (Laura Dern) and unable to connect emotionally with her nice guy husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski), her only release comes from engaging in some seriously self-destructive behavior.  But, Paul ultimately her leaves her for her infidelities and she realizes that she’s no longer in control (not that she ever was) and that she’s allowed her life to spiral down dangerously close to the edge of the abyss.  She tries cut-rate psycho-therapy for about 5 minute before giving up.  When the therapist asks why she does the things she does, she responds by saying, the only time life doesn’t hurt like sh*t is when I’m fuc*ing someone or shooting up.  As an act of desperation, and despite the fact that she has no backpacking experience, she leaves home (Minneapolis) to hike the 1,100 mile Pacific Crest Trail - which runs from the Mojave Desert in California to Washington State - by herself.  The movie is about her trek.  The movie has a grittiness and real-life feel to it.  The only odd moment occurs in the closing scene where, despite the fact that the journey proves to be her salvation, Cheryl tries to embrace her past rather than renounce it and claims that she doesn’t seek or need forgiveness or redemption.  It’s a prideful “broken but unbowed” final speech, which I found interesting given that her survival appears to be founded as much on luck and the kindness of strangers as it is on her own inner strength.  But, despite Cheryl’s lack of humility, you still feel good that she makes it through both the Pacific wilderness and her own personal wilderness and through to other side.  Stay and watch the credits for some interesting photographs of the real Cheryl."" ]";3;5;3;2;0;0.0

The problem is that Gone Girl is more than that, is a combination with a psychological thriller (characteristic more distinguishable in the book), and is here where Fincher fails; the torment and questioning that invades not only the protagonists, but also Go and Amy's parents, its not so clear in the film. Another huge problem is Ben Affleck, he makes Nick a static character, its impossible to empathize with him, though same parts of the movie requires it, others not. Nevertheless, Rosamund Pike is magnificent as Amy, which compensates everything."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0.0

The interesting thing is how similar is this film with the previous one of Lee Daniels, Precious. In both movies the protagonist fights between three worlds, Precious was debating with her traumatic past, the inescapable present and the fantastic other reality where she is a star. Here Cecil lives between his job as a butler, where he only serves and never talk or react to the opinion of white people; his home life, where his wife feels abandoned and his child has revolutionary thoughts; and all the movements against racist practices that starts all over the country. Another topic that deserves to be mentioned is how this picture evaluates two forms of changing the world and point out that if you want to accomplish something you must be open to other possibilities even if is necessary to go back on ones word and recognize an error. Add to all these, a magnificent performances of Whitaker and Oprah, thrilling action sequences, elaborated script, a great direction;  and you get an amazing film. But what it lacks in the story (in contrast to Precious) is more shocking reality and a best use of the illumination, music and camera."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0.0

What this picture is doing, is trying to figure out what is love, using apart from the plot, the script, the cameras and the performances. That is why the movie is so slow, with static camera movements and with people that evaluate what they are doing, because you cannot rush love, it is about patience and understanding.

The interesting thing is the way in which the plot develops; because with little jokes and making fun of stereotypes, treat topics like discrimination, perseverance and fear. The attractive thing about fear is that this movie takes it to the next level, since this is a feeling with the power of changing who you are; so if you do not let it control you, is possible to have a beautiful life with no regrets. Another captivating thing is the sort of expressionism with which was constructed the animated characters.

All this produce constant fights between Edward and his son; and this is one of the topics that Tim Burton treats on his films.

The interesting thing here is that this girl is discovering the world, learning how to survive. But she is frightened of the unknown things, which are for example living independently, detachment from the family, own survival, civilized humans, melting icecaps and storms; all these things are represented as strange and fantastic creatures that chase the protagonist. The problem is that Hushpuppy insists on trying to hold on the things she had sometime, that is why she is a mess without her father or likes to talk to a shirt pretending to be her absent mother. Another exciting topic is that the only thing that the protagonist knows for sure is that everything fits perfectly in the universe and has a natural course, so one change should lead to another.

The big thing is how these three tales are mixed up to reveal the real essence of the protagonist, his objectives, joys, fears and concerns. The complexity of this character is beyond imagination, there are no words to describe Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, probably nobody could have done better; he definitely carries the movie on his shoulders.

Despite, “Selma” (2015), directed by critically acclaimed African-American director Ava DuVernay (known for “Middle of Nowhere”(2012) and “I will follow” (2010)), is “A chronicle of MLK’s campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965”."", """", ""Firstly, I was skeptical going into this movie, very much aware that this is a two-hour biography about a certain period in a great man’s life, a hero in particular, thus this movie could be interesting but if not brilliantly handled in production, as a result could instead be dull. To my surprise, this is one of the best movies I have seen thus far this year. This was an absolute treat because it is always in January in which you can seek out films for your worst list, however “Selma” (2015) featured an outstanding, truly Oscar-Worthy performance from David Oyelowo (known for “A Most Violent Year” (2014) and “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” (2013)) in which he perfectly portrayed Martin Luther King showing not only his status but also his imperfections as a human being. Basically Oyelowo brought back MLK to life with his electrifying performance. The film also features great supporting roles from Carmen Ejogo (known for “The Purge: Anarchy” (2014)) as MLK’s devoted wife and the beloved Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper."", """", ""Moreover, this movie has shocking intense and emotional sequences in which the “white” officers fight “black” citizens marching to Montgomery as an ask for their voting rights. The two marches are heart pounding yet enormous and highly constructed therefore, made me appreciate this feature even more. The movie is overall well-directed, well-written and sharply edited, with MLK’s speeches shinning more than ever."", """", ""In conclusion, this feature might not be appealing to most teenagers, however schools could benefit from teaching it in classes as it holds valuable information about one great icon of history. It also carries out great positive messages such as “the triumphs and challenges of the civil rights movements and the importance to gather a diverse community to fight racism”. With great positive role models mainly MLK. (“He is not “idealized” in this movie as his flaws are addressed, but he is no shortage of incredible role models among the civil rights leaders”). Subsequently, I highly recommend seeing “Selma” (2015)."" ]";2;4;2;2;0;0.0

It's got the bombastic energy of an action film, the brutality of a serious war movie, and the heart and soul of a compelling human drama. This conclusion to the Reeves trilogy is excellent and hands down the best of the reboots. While the door is left open for more to potentially come from the series in the future, War is good enough to serve as the conclusion of the Apes films.

A work this polished and well-executed is something many directors who have been in the game for years fail to achieve. The performances are incredible. If Daniel Kaluuya does not get on Oscar for his performance here then something has gone horribly wrong. His performance as a guy who is just trying to make the best of an awkward scenario, but slowly losing his ability to as things get progressively stranger is nothing short of absolutely believable. The rest of the cast is game as well. They're manipulation and bizarre behavior set you on edge in ways few other movies can. The scenes are lovingly crafted and the choice in music that accompanies them is spot on."", ""It's the originality that ultimately wins the day. First time director Peele toys with your expectations in interesting ways. He's done so since before the movie even came out. The social-commentary in regards to racial tensions is something that stirred up a lot of controversy. There are people who won't even give the movie a shot as a result. Their loss. The satire not only shines light on some significant social issues, but is excellently weaved into the plot as a reason to make the main character uncomfortable with meeting his girlfriend's parents in the first place. Needless to day, partially because so many others have said it, it's not racist. Not some middle finger to white people or anything like that. But, whatever. Not gonna bother talking about it any further. People have already made up their minds on what they think this is about."", ""If the movie has one flaw it's that you can kind of pick out the twists before they happen. Don't get me wrong, there are still surprises in store. It's just that the big reveal as to why exactly all of this is happening is evident right before it is revealed. It was too well telegraphed to not become immediately obvious. Then there's the bit that has to do with a significant character to the plot. It was obvious what was going to happen there from the trailers. Still, plenty of weirdness and questions you'll find yourself asking (which will get answered)."", ""The movie is essentially an awkward introduction to being introduced to the parents of a significant other. The difference from this and, say, the Ben Stiller comedy \""Meet the Parents\"" is the horror angle. Instead of increasingly upping the humor, Get Out ups the mystery, tension, and uncomfortable nature of the events. Speaking of the humor, it's worth noting just how surprisingly funny the movie is. Most of it comes from Lil Rel Howery, the main character's best friend. He serves as the comic relief and is given some absolutely hilarious lines that are well acted. Simply put, Get Out is one heck of a horror-comedy and a stunning directorial debut from Jordan Peele. I can't get over how talented the cast is, the unique and well-shot scenes, the clever ways it plays with expectations, and just all around uniqueness. Get Out proves to be a standout in the ever crowded horror genre. It's rare these days to see a movie in this genre so well made. It's becoming more common, but still far too infrequent.

Who would've thought a kids movie would be the one to examine the effects Batman's past tragedies have had on the character and the way his self-destructive life style blurs the lines between hero and villain. It's the most mature and meaningful bit of Bat-fiction in years, and it's been brought to life with animated Legos and family-friendly humor. The animation style is still really interesting. The screen does regularly get cluttered, making it hard to keep track of what's going on during some of it's larger action scenes. The voice cast is phenomenal and I loved the new takes on classic characters. There are also plenty of nods to Batman's long history in both comics, TV shows, movies, and much more. The amount of obscure Batman villains alone is sure to bring a smile to the face of any longtime Batman fan and excite the imaginations and interest of those who haven't heard of them."", ""The story is simply great.

Deeper than pretty much any other movie about the character with maybe the exception of the Nolan trilogy.

Every time Wick finds himself without a gun that is always his fallback move. It's noticeable and a little weird. The gunplay however is flawless, fast, and furious. I can't think of another time where it's been this much fun watching people get shot in the head. There also may be an issue with the actual writing. Personally, I didn't notice this, but one person I know who watched it mentioned how it felt like they had seen it before because they could predict how everything was  going to play out in the final third of the film, right down to the dialog. Not a big deal in my opinion either way because of how strong the action is. Besides, it's not like the first John Wick is known for redefining plots fo rthe action movie genre."", ""If you wanted more John Wick then Chapter 2 will most certainly deliver. It has got some of the most exciting fights and shoot outs around. Plus there is style to spare. With a lot of great side-characters and villains to fill in the world and more details into all these rules Wick must follow, there's new here to go along with the familiar.

He takes things to another level and the movie goes to show his outstanding ability as an actor. He's not the only notable person onscreen though. While everyone else is pretty much playing the standard character roles one would expect in this kind of movie, there is Danny McBride really stepping out of his comedic comfort zone in favor of a surprisingly emotional performance.

Whether it is the weird accents or the overly-serious Will Smith, something is a little off in the acting department, but overall they still do a good job. There are also some duds in the dialog. A section where Will Smith describes to his son when he lost the ability to afraid ends up being overly cheesy thanks to some goofy lines. These flaws do hurt the film, but only a little. All of the issues end up fading away when faced with the more emotional or intense moments. All I have left to say is that I highly enjoyed this movie and recommend it. It's a movie that manages to overcome its flaws and create an experience unlike any science fiction movie I've seen before."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0.0

Yeah they changed the suit, and while I'm still not cool with it I have to admit it's not a bad looking suit. They did add a few more elements from the comics this time around. Peter is a high-schooler, has web-shooters this time around, and Gwen Stacy is the love interest this time around, and they all make the movie feel fresh. It's the same origin story we saw in the first Spider-Man movie back in 2002, but they manage to make their own changes to these familiar scenes to make them different rather than a complete retread. A big addition to the series is the mystery behind Peter's parents, which is something I can't wait to see where they take it. The movie is fantastic and Spidey fans will not be disappointed, however it does have some flaws, they left out Spider-Man's spider sense, and didn't include the classic \""With great power comes great responsibility\"". While leaving out Spidey's spider sense isn't really a big deal at all, just noticeable (and to be honest I really didn't miss it), the fact that they left out those powerful words from Peter's Uncle Ben (at least in my opinion) is horrible and never should have happened.

night-of-the-living-dead;9;TheQuietGamer;/user/TheQuietGamer;Jul 22, 2017;"[ ""The movie that started it all. Every piece of popular zombie fiction, from movies to TV shows and comics and video games, owes there existence to this film. George Romero's innovative and groundbreaking vision laid the framework for countless years of undead entertainment. Every trope, idea, rule, and moral conundrum you'll see in all of the zombie content that has come out over the years and has yet to can be found here. It's amazing to watch this, think of when it came out, and still see how all zombie fiction is using the exact same ideas. So next time you  are watching an episode of The Walking Dead or playing some Zombies Mode in Call of Duty, just know that they wouldn't exist were it not for \""Night of the Living Dead.\"""", ""Of course it wouldn't matter that Romero did it first if he hadn't done it well. Night of the Living Dead holds up remarkably well after all these years. If anything, with the exception of (maybe) the low budget and some inexperienced acting, time might have actually improved this movie. It's black and white visuals, retro soundtrack, and to the basics approach add a tone and atmosphere to this that the refinements of the modern age can't always capture. I will admit that there is a lot of what I guess you could call empty space in the movie. The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit."", ""While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other. Fortunately, it's the one the swordsman doesn't have to worry about cutting (or worse, impaling) himself on. Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today. Zombie fan or not, horror fan or not, movie buff or not, if you consider yourself a fan of fine cinema then this a must watch. Not only is it historic, but it's also fantastic as well. One of the most important, influential, and just darn enjoyable horror movies ever created."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

Spider-Man and the X-Men were doing fine, and even Blade did well enough to get himself a trilogy. The rest of the Marvel heroes though? Not so much. They were met with poor reviews and disappointed fans. Even The Punisher was met with critical backlash, although for the life of me I can't see why."", ""It's an awesome origin story that plays out as a superhero revenge story. It's dark, brutal, and Thomas Jane absolutely nails it as Frank Castle.

Unlike Daredevil it actually manages to nail the mature, gritty tone. Something a lot of superhero movies have struggled with over the years and even still do."", ""It's interesting to see how many familiar faces were pulled from Punisher comics to fill out the supporting cast. The movie offers quite a bit of fan-service for those who are clued in. The mob family Castle sees himself fighting against feels a little generic, and Travolta is surprisingly flat as the main villain, but none of that gets in the way of how satisfying the violence is. It's also got an old-school feel. Revenge has never been quite so satisfying."", ""Yes, the early 2000s weren't the kindest to a lot of Marvel's characters. The critics took shots at The Punisher that honestly feel undeserved. During a time when Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and even Hulk were failing to do those classic characters justice (they really tried though, I'll give them that), The Punisher stood tall and delivered. It's one heck of a satisfying revenge flick, a bleak vigilante tale, a throwback to the gritty action movies of the 70's and 80's, and something truly different from every other superhero movie out there.

Dare I say it, if Paul Thomas Anderson had tried to make this movie with anyone else other than Sandler, the results probably wouldn't have been this good. It would have been harder to overlook the nonsensical moments the director throws in or his intentionally cheap, amateurish camera work (most evident in the way it pans the screen). All of which feels kind of pretentious. The remarkable thing is that none of this really feels all that far out of Sandler's wheelhouse. It's not the majority of the stuff he's been in hasn't had him playing as a character with anger problems before. The difference is that the material here is just deeper and requires more range from him. It's amazing that more people aren't taking advantage of this. That they can't see what Anderson saw in him. I don't blame other people in Hollywood kind of losing faith in him and not wanting to give him a chance based on all those critically panned comedies he's made over the years. Especially lately where even as a fan I have to admit he hasn't been trying as hard as he used to. Still, it's not as though he hasn't come out of his comfort zone following this. He's shown he can rise to the occasion for more serious material in film's like Reign Over Me or Spanglish, among others. Come one people, throw the man a bone. He's still got it in him to deliver movies like this."", ""Punch-Drunk Love proves to be a meaningful, romantic, and at times outright hilarious dark comedy that features an outstanding performance from an actor who most people wouldn't and still don't think is capable of one. The movie even manages to get it out of him while playing to a few of his expected strengths in the process. Simply put, the movie gives one of cinema's biggest critical punching bags some good material from a proven director and lets us watch him rise to the occasion.

However when it comes to getting believable performances from all of the cast, he stumbles. Actors like Ewan McGregor, Sir Christopher Lee, and Samuel Jackson do good to great jobs at their characters, but some of the cast just give poor performances.

Either way they help to add to a certain cheesy feel of the movie. Also adding to it is the occasionally awkward dialog.

That's all you really need."", """", ""The climactic battle of man vs. beast is excellent. The movie doesn't shy away from giving you the bloody deaths when you want them. It just doesn't go out of it's way to overindulge in them.

The characters here are real people. They make real decisions and act like a real family. Elements of the film make it part horror-comedy because of how realistically it portrays how people act.

Even today after all these years there is still nothing like it. A trend I've noticed a lot with the old horror classics. Some would say we don't see horror films like this anymore due to the progression of time leading to new forms of style being needed for the genre. I disagree. There is a sense of imagination to the scenes that we don't see anymore. Crazy crap happens here that blows all of the lame jump scares and similar looking specters that plague the horror flicks of today out of the water. Not too mention the themes it tackles. Something the vast majority of more modern horror movies don't do at all."", """", ""A return of this style of horror movie would be most welcome.

One that I wish more modern directors would take cues from. It's got believable characters, a fantastic story, and that wonderful sense of deranged imagination.

Why don't more movies try something like that?\"" It's one of the best examples of how to do the genre right and because of that even after all these years it feels remarkably fresh.

carrie-1976;9;TheQuietGamer;/user/TheQuietGamer;Jul 11, 2017;"[ ""A pretty faithful adaptation of the Stephen King novel. The ending is different and nowhere near as explosive (literally) as the one in the book, and you'll also likely notice some different takes on a few characters as well. Yet, little of what made that tale so powerful gets lost in the move to the big-screen. The heartbreaking nature of the events are expertly captured and Sissy Spacek is a darn-near perfect Carrie despite being as skinny as a rail post (in the book the character is a touch overweight). She carries the heart and sole of the character with her awkward, sympathetic, and ultimately powerful performance. The movie is sure to strike a chord with anyone who has ever been bullied. It also serves as one of the best anti-bullying messages there is. No, not because Carrie eventually has her revenge on all those who tormented her. Instead it is because of the ability the story has to make us feel what Carrie feels. Her loneliness, hurt, fear, and embarrassment are channeled into the viewer thanks to Spacek. Her performance has the power to express what the character is going through beneath the surface almost as well as the words on the pages on the novel do. It's incredible stuff and makes the final act all the more riveting and crushing as we watch Carrie rise only to be let down again."", ""As a horror movie it is both beautifully shot and not very frightening. The real terror comes not from jumps on the screen, but from the at times awful nature of our fellow human beings. The blood certainly does flow in the final act, which is both spectacular and violent, but I wouldn't go as far as calling this a \""scary\"" movie in the traditional sense. It's the subject matter that makes it a part of the horror genre. It's also worth noting how beautifully shot this is. It's an excellent recreation of the book even if liberties have been taken and alterations have been made here and there, ensuring that it isn't a 100% faithful adaptation. These deviations aren't really a big deal. Yes, the book is a masterpiece, but this movie does so much right that it most certainly stands on it's own as it captures so much of what made the book so incredible."", ""It's a heart-wrenching story and I think one of the best darn horror movies ever made. Certainly a contender for the best Stephen King adaptation. You owe it to yourself to see why this movie and character are so iconic. It's a quality offering in just about every way.

No, it isn't that what bothers me specifically, just that she felt out of place at times. It would have been better if they had chosen someone like Maggie Q or Kim So-yeon.

In both films their authors decided to create confrontation between \""good\"" heroes, thus adding philosophical depth and psychological authenticity to the heroes. Also both films have raised up a problem of the so-called \""collateral damage\"" and responsibility for consequences of superheroes actions."", """", ""While not referring to the question \""which movie is better\"", I'll try to ask myself a question \""why the theme of confrontation between the \""forces of good\"" appeared in the film adaptations now?\"" I think the answer lies in the domestic US problems. Criticism of Bush's foreign policy and national security measure, I think, were essential in raising \""collateral damage\"" problem and control of power in original comic book series. Coming to power of the \""leftist dove of peace\"" Obama that has transformed now into a crisis of the US political establishment, manifested in the appearance of presidential candidates like socialist Sanders and populist Trump, tells about upcoming serious reformatting of traditional American values. What twenty five years ago has seemed unshakeable foundation of the US - individual freedom, liberalism, individualism, Christianity, reliance on the middle class, the belief in the \""American mission\"", the constitutional rights, the right to freely carry weapons, the belief in the intransigence of good and evil (so- called \""freedom values\"") - is increasingly shifting now to the so- called \""safety values\"" - strengthening of state control and regulation, taxation, reliance on large corporations on the one hand, and people with low incomes, on the other, with the simultaneous impoverishment of the middle class, atheism, restriction of the right to carry weapons, moral relativism, non-interference in the affairs of third countries. This US' \""offset of values\"", with the polarization of the supporters of \""freedom values\"" and supporters of \""safety values\"", I think, is reflected by the both blockbusters."", """", ""In the previous Russo's work with Captain's story we already saw clash of these values when heroes revealed that evil has grown up inside of SHIELD and its operatives and head were converted to the HYDRA's side arguing that security and control will finish the world's chaos. In this Captain's story the same message was hidden by Ross brothers more subtly, when right and wrong sides are not so clear. As in life, it is difficult to see the evil in someone everyone accustomed to consider to be a hero and who considers himself to be good (as well as all villains)."", """", ""On the one hand there is Captain - the embodiment of the \""freedom values\"" - who believes that you can not shift the responsibility for your actions on others including the state (like, for example, the Nazis did) or a coalition of states, knows that there \""at the top\"" just ordinary people with their ambitions and desires, and that he won't become a puppet in the hands of cynical politicians only in order to get rid of guilt and absolve himself of responsibility. He is the embodiment of belief in uncompromising, absolute good and evil, inviolability of principles, justice, even if they are not supported by the majority, which out of fear is ready to give up freedom in exchange for security, to exchange risk-taking birthright for a guaranteed onion soup. On the other hand there is the Iron Man, oddly enough, the epitome of the \""security values\"" - he comes from large corporations, he wishes to subdue the group's activities to external control, to absolve himself of responsibility, and thus in some way (how?) to protect others from \""collateral damage\""."", """", ""If motivation of Captain America is transparent - responsibility, adherence to the principles and concepts of good and evil, even if they are contrary to written laws, as well as loyalty to friendship, the Stark's motivation is questionable. Does he made his decision due to the conscious or unconscious desire to split the group and take the leadership from Captain America, isn't there monstrous selfishness hidden behind the rantings about the need to \""control\"" (again, it is not clear how such controls could prevent \""collateral damage\""), maybe it is thirst for power and, at the same time, desire to absolve himself of any responsibility for the \""collateral damage\""? Look at the motivation of the real villains (Commies, Nazis) - they wanted to create a perfect system with total control for the \""security\"" of common fellows, who they sought, were unable to bear the burden of freedom. Ultron was alike, but he grabbed his delusion ideas from Stark. For me, Stark is the main villain of the film. He begins to pursue those who disagree with him - put a pressure on them, put them (Wanda) under arrest. It is similar to most of the tyrants, a typical villain who wants to trample his opinion as one and only and to eliminate all who disagree."", """", ""Behaviour of Black widow seems illogical - she is a clear candidate for Captain's team (unless she has stayed with Stark for sabotage like in the hangar scene). But suffering from guilt Wanda would rather choose Stark's side that allows her to shift responsibility to someone else. But she has chosen the right path of \""growing up\"" - accepting responsibility. In the \""Age of Ultron\"" she had read Stark's mind and warned Cap that Stark is \""capable of anything\""."", """", ""Distracting from the current political and philosophical background of the film, it may be noted that in terms of action this Marvel's cinema-comics keeps the style and the brand - despite the seriousness of the plot, Marvel's ease and jokes are still there even during fierce battles.

Spielberg's typical sentimentality and \""Gemütlichkeit\"" (\""cosiness, friendliness\"") evokes Jung's suspicions about hardness of heart, insensitivity and callousness hiding behind them. So it's understandable why I was not particularly interested in this director's movies. On the other hand, the scriptwriting involved Cohen snobs, who, with their limitations, grotesque and constant misanthropic giggling, also didn't evoke much enthusiasm. However surprisingly, combined efforts of the creator of sentimental trash and pair of arrogant cartoonists gave quite a good result. \""Bridge of Spies\"" is, of course, not without typical drawbacks of Spielberg's and Cohen's flicks - from the pathetic tearfulness to the evil burlesque - but these flaws compensate each other to some extent and give the film an unexpected depth."", """", ""So the vulgar movie maker and pair of snobs unexpectedly created very interesting flick - sometimes quite rough, consisting of two separate movies (a quite weak legal drama and spy thriller) - that will keep you in suspense during almost all of its two hours. And what is particularly captivating, this is done without the involvement of a love story (with only a hint of romantic line of American student which, fortunately, wasn't developed further), without naked women, shootings and car chases. But with excellent dialogues, witty humour and catchy phrases (\""Will it help?\"") in the Hollywood movies of 1980th style. For me, however, \""Bridge of Spies\"" is first of all three episodes: a conversation in a restaurant between Hoffman and Donovan, Donovan's statement before the Supreme Court and the conversation between Donovan and Powers.

Then, at the first reading in adolescence, \""Starship Troopers\"", as I now realize, had an opposite influence on me to that conceived by the author, although it caused an intense inner dialogue. Perhaps it is due to its peculiar \""extremist\"" philosophy, conjugated with an idealized description of an army life and the nuances of the officers' service, I've remembered this book among hundreds and thousands of others which I've read at the same period. Although at the time it was seen by me more like an action adventure, and not as political manifesto of the author. Over time, of course, the book is perceived quite differently, and I fully agree with and support the decision of the publisher, who refused to publish the \""Troopers\"" for young audience, because instead of novel of professional science fiction writer, young readers would've received novel of an unprofessional philosopher.

If the book is more sincere and deep, actual science fiction and social modelling, the film is more social satire, caricature and propaganda poster on the verge of trash. It is difficult to say which is better or worse, because they are completely different art expressions. And although to me either Heinlein's idealistic military meritocracy and Verhoeven's leftist pacifism are equally unsympathetic, I can not help but admit that aesthetically I like both the novel and the film - each in its own way. That, of course, does not negate the madness of the inflated to absurd ideas underlying both works. Actually, I would advise to watch a movie to those who are able to separate the ideological background from the artistic value of these works.

This movie was my most anticipated movie of January and boy was I happy when I left. James McAvoy delivers one of the best performances ever (probably his best) as he portrays Kevin's 24 identities. Anya Taylor-Joy was also really good in this film as well as the other two girls and Betty Buckley. M Night Shyamalan delivers once again a unique, fun, interesting thriller. Split had some very good scenes (although sadly, some of them were shown in the trailer), as well as some memorable ones. Split also has a ton of humor, which works incredibly well. However, there were some flaws with movie, one of which was the thriller aspect. The movie had a ton of incredibly well acted scenes, but the film lacked suspense in some ways, which slightly disappointed me. Also, I thought the trailer gave a bit too much, so some good scenes were already spoiled. That being said, Split still delivered a great plot and a satisfying ending. I thought the film length was just about right, which is very rare. Split was a major improvement over The Visit and James McAvoy delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. I recommend everyone to go see this film. Also, for some reason, I can't seem to get Split out of my head, due to the amazing well-told story, which is why I'm giving it a high score.

Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Haley Lu Richardson, Hayden Szeto, Blake Jenner, and everyone else in the movie had near-perfect acting. In fact, everyone acted so well that I felt like I was in every scene of the movie, myself. The relationship between Nadine and Krista from little to grown up was so touching; in fact, it is my favorite friend group in a movie. The movie was so relatable to my daily life and all the relationships were beyond incredible. The movie was funny, dramatic, and touching all at the same time, without being over length. Erwin and Nadine's relationship was cute and all the main characters were likable. Hailee Steinfeld's acting was incredible and she gave the best performance of her acting career. I think this movie should've gotten at least a nomination for best acting and best picture. Woody Harrelson played the role of a likable teacher, which I thought was amazing. The movie, itself, without all the likable characters probably wouldn't deserve such a high rating. The Edge of Seventeen did seem a bit unrealistic at times, but it was entertaining and it touched my heart. I have been thinking about this movie for days as it was so touching. Other than that, I thought the Edge of Seventeen was a beautiful film that should start a new genre of filmmaking - one that touches the daily lives of teens.

hacksaw-ridge;10;Th3GreenHorne7;/user/Th3GreenHorne7;Nov  6, 2016;"[ ""Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, and Hugo Weaving in a story that takes place in the time of World War II where Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield enlists in the United States Army to become a combat medic and his participation in the war was for him to save lives instead of taking them. Now I'm a big WWII nut, I love the time period, and as much as I know about it, this story was nothing but unknown to me, but I now know a big part of the battle of Okinawa a little bit more clearly. Hacksaw Ridge is culmination of what it's like to have something as your beliefs tested and questioned while struggling to stay faithful in what you believe in. The film itself is a shockingly realistic re-enactment of of the pinnacle of the pacific theater of war during WWII, Mel Gibson re-catches the attention of the world as he makes his comeback to the directing world with a film so emotionally deep and such frighteningly realistic scenes of brutal war violence that it's easily comparable to Saving Private Ryan when it comes to showing the audience what it's like to see the horrors of war through someone else's eyes. Andrew Garfield surprised me so much, he really held the film up, when I first heard he was going to have the lead role I was very nervous because his role as Spider-Man in the Amazing Spider-Man films was not that great so to hear that he was taking the helm in a very serious role such as Desmond Doss made me very skeptical of how he might portray his character in this film, but after seeing this film I was totally blown away by how much dedication he gave to Desmond, honestly if he does not get at least a Golden Globe or Oscar Nomination I will be really mad. The supporting cast was amazing, I was surprised to see Vince Vaughn in serious role compared to comedian Hollywood normally views him as. Sam Worthington was also amazing, before this, I have not seen him in very many movies since Avatar but this was definitely one of his better roles that he has ever done. As for Luke Bracey, Hugo Weaving, and Teresa Palmer, they were also amazing in the roles they had. The acting in this film is one the best aspects of the film, but to me what really made this film unbelievably great was the cinematography, the production design, and the make-up made this film really shine with undeniably realistic and graphic battle scenes, beautiful wide shots, and the gore in this film is so gruesome that it's very difficult to forget it all, but that's how war is. Out of all the World War II films I have seen in my life, Hacksaw Ridge is now one of my favorite WWII films I have ever seen, and I am very impressed with Mel Gibson's directing work in this film, I can't wait to see other films in the future that he will direct because Hacksaw Ridge is in my opinion a unforgettable masterpiece, and one of Mel Gibson's best director work since Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ. Hacksaw Ridge is a film to remember in the coming future."" ]";4;5;4;1;0;0.0
logan-2017;10;Th3GreenHorne7;/user/Th3GreenHorne7;Nov 14, 2017;"[ ""This is it, after 17 years we finally get the wolverine film we have been waiting for. Logan is a harrowing yet beautiful end to to these characters the we have following since they first appeared in the first X-Men film back in 2001. When I saw the first trailer for Logan, I didn't really understand what was happening, so I watched it over and over again, and after a dozen viewings, I suddenly understood what was about to come, yet I still had many theories and many questions. Logan is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Richard E. Grant, and Dafne Keen. In a time when mutants are almost completely non existent (Almost) and the only one who are left are forced to flee and hide from society because they are being hunted. Logan, Xavier, and Caliban are hiding in an abandoned plant in Mexico. I will say this, if there is anyone in this film that screams Oscar worthy, it's Hugh Jackman, and Patrick Stewart, these two actors have done more than just earned the right to be nominated, they deserve to be nominated. They have dedicated a good chunk of their careers into these characters, you couldn't ask for anything better. Watching this film is a rather unusual experience if you didn't see the 2 previous X-Men films, even if you watch them, the experience is still unusual. It seems the closer the MCU gets to Infinity War, the more emotionally deep comic book films get. This film is also rated R, and DAMN, it really earns that R rating, it's bloody, it's gory, it's dark and brooding, yet oddly satisfying and relieving. From the very beginning it's pretty obvious that there is no hope left for these characters, they have finally reached the end of their road, and they are tired, they are torn both physically and mentally and they just want the suffering to end, which leads me to the deaths of both Logan and Xavier. When Xavier dies at the hands of X-24 (Logan's Perfect clone of himself) my heart shattered into a million pieces, I thought he deserved better than that, but it felt appropriate for the situation at hand. I cried for a few minutes, and knew that in order for it to get better, it must get worse first, which it did. When it came to Logan's death, I knew it was coming, one way or another, and when it came to that moment after Logan killed X-24, I knew it was time. At the moment he died, I cried once more, but was glad that Logan felt love one last time, just a little glimmer of it, and then he was gone. I know this review looks like a personal summary of the film, because that's exactly what it is, I didn't know any other way to review it by telling everyone how it felt on an emotional level, I saw this film back in March when it came out, and 8 months later, it still hurts. Now I'll talk about everything else. The visual effects where amazing from the brutally blood and gory moments where Logan and X-23 (Logan's Daughter/Clone) are slashing of limbs and decapitating really unlucky people, it's shockingly amazing. I have to give big credit to the score by Marco Beltrami, it really felt like it didn't belong in a comic book movie, at certain times it was breathtaking, intense, depressing, even frightening, I definitely do think the score is Oscar worthy. The cinematography is another Oscar worthy part of this film, yes this is a Marvel comics movie with a few Marvel characters, but it didn't feel like a comic book movie, it felt more like a modern western mixed with drama, and a lot of action, it's like what The Dark Knight did when that didn't feel like a comic book film, it pushed the boundaries of these film can accomplish by pushing the genre to a whole new level, and that's exactly what Logan has done. Logan is the perfect example of a film that can really change a certain film genre, in a sense it's revolutionary, it's an accomplishment that is hard to muster but easy to screw up, but here it is done remarkably well. I really hope that for a while now, like at least a few years before any word about Wolverine coming back to life doesn't happen because this character needs to rest, he's been through a lot. Like everyone has been saying, this is Hugh Jackman's swan song as the Wolverine, and I will always be fan of Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine, and I will be hesitant when someone else take charge of this character, but Hugh Jackman will forever and always be The Wolverine."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

Now, I know I wasted characters listing the cast, but it was worth it, because this movie was amazing, and very surprising. The film goes through multiple flashback for the first 30 minutes of the film, it shows where Bucky was before The Winter Soldier, Bucky was being kept under ice just like finding Captain in ice, but Bucky was in a Russian controlled facility. It was great to know that they did a bit more backstory on Bucky because it was still hard to figure out how Bucky became The Winter Soldier. The main story can be somewhat compared to the comics, it had some elements from the comics which were great. The cast of this film was unbelievable, for a film with this many comic book characters in one whole movie, the cast really brought those characters off the pages and onto the Big Screen into Marvel Cinematic Universe, and those characters that have been brought back and first time being on screen like Black Panther, and Crossbones, while Ant-Man, War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Sharon Carter have been brought back after being in previous film in the MCU. The Biggest surprise for me was Tom Holland who played Spider-Man, he knocked it out of the park as Spider-Man, he was even better than Andrew Garfield which was an even bigger surprise because I thought what can be worse than Andrew Garfield? I thought Holland was going to be even worse than Garfield, but now I realize that I was so wrong, I mean Holland was hilarious, funniest Spider-Man ever. The whole cast really was awesome, I'm really glad that in the end they set up the Black Panther movie and they teased the new Spider-Man movie. Overall, Civil War was damn good, I cannot see how this movie could be executed any better than what I saw.

The characters make up for the amazing acting and the real emotions coming from them, the animation is so alive and so bright even when the picture is very dark. But the real reason that this film is the next big Disney masterpiece? It's the inspirational messages that the film presents, and in this film the message falls under the lines of vengeance does not become received by revenge, and learning to let go is a hard thing but to some people, it a natural instinct, and wherever you go, take some friends with you, because you could be something bigger and stronger when you have help, sure in the end some people don't make it but that right there is the message, staying strong in the face of challenges, that's what makes Big Hero 6 a masterpiece."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

And Rocky Balboa had a more calm role, but knows that he can't ignore that he has to train Adonis to be the best, and probably better than his father, but Rocky eventually finds out that he has a form of cancer, but that doesn't stop him from making Adonis the best he can be, which the sums up the fact that the performances of the actors were great. The fight sequences were quite an improvement as the camera movements had fluid, dynamic and clear. The music was just as motivational as the music from Rocky.

The story follows the amnesiac titular character (Damon) as he attempts to find out more about his past as a black ops agent for the CIA. One of the things I noticed first about this film was the film's shift in aesthetics. Though Director Paul Greengrass' use of hand-held cameras has often come under considerable disagreement from some critics and fans, I feel that this aspect of the film really sort of adds to the intensity of a lot of the action and dialogue sequences. While the camerawork may have changed, there are certain things about the film that stayed close to what made the first movie so successful. For one, Matt Damon's performance is once again terrific, and with his portrayal, the audience really gets to see some sides of Jason Bourne that they might not gotten to see in \""Identity\"". John Powell's score is really well done, as it uses all of the themes from \""Identity\"", but develops upon those themes so that we feel as though we are watching a different chapter in Bourne's life. Tony Gilroy's screenplay contains really compelling and entertaining dialogue and a very interesting adaption of Robert Ludlum's story. The action sequences are spectacular as well, for they once again showcase Jason Bourne's incredible ability to overcome immense odds with the skills he learned in the CIA.

philadelphia;9;Compi24;/user/Compi24;Nov 28, 2012;"[ ""\""Philadelphia\"" is the story of Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a promising young lawyer at an upscale law firm. When the homosexual Beckett suddenly contracts AIDS he is fired unfairly fired from his workplace. Beckett then seeks the help of a small time homophobic lawyer, Joe Miller (Washington), to establish a wrongful dismissal case. Now from initial premise and the fact that I had heard Tom Hanks earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, I was expecting a fairly memorable movie. And I got one. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best and most moving performances with his portrayal of Beckett. Probably one of the most dynamic roles I've ever seen Hanks take on. He starts out as such a vibrant young man, yet as the film progresses, Beckett's illness does as well. Consequently, the audience witnesses the decline of a seemingly healthy man to a man who's body has been ravaged by an incurable disease. It's really quite heartbreaking. Tom Hanks worked well for this Oscar. Along side Hanks is Washington, who also gives a fine performance as the conflicted lawyer Miller. Like Beckett, Miller goes through a significant change as well - only his soul changes, not his health. It's really quite interesting to see Washington and Hanks work together on screen, as I've never seen it happen in any other film. The film also features a very well written script and a very nice direction from Jonathon Demme. The ending of this film is really quite something, and. . .yeah, I'll say it - the conclusion of this film was really intense for me to watch. Pretty emotional stuff. Overall I felt that \""Philadelphia\"" is a poignant tale that succeeds in addressing many issues that have often been neglected in our time. I felt that it was filled to the brim with fine performances and palpable pathos. It's a great movie that I won't soon forget. Awesome."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

I believe so, for I have seen a multitude of films with similar concepts that have come out since \""The Bourne Identity\""'s release. However, most, if not all, of the movies that have tried to replicate what The \""Bourne\"" movie's have done, cannot reach the level of intrigue that each of the \""Bourne\"" movies have reached - and they promptly fall flat in comparison.

I'd have to say that this film is easily one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s. The overall premise of the movie is really novel as well as provocative, and all the performances help to ...tell this complex narrative with great intensity. The film's story also delves into some very complex literary topics, such as: determinism vs. free-will, legality vs. politics, and Self-perception. One of my favorite aspects of the film is the way it's shot. In terms of lighting, Spielberg used a deep contrast between lights and darks which really helps to give the film a sort of a badass neo-noir feel. Spielberg also bleach-bypassed the negatives of the film in order to desaturate the colors of overlit scenes. Both of these technical aspects helped to achieve the very unique visual style that this movie has to offer - I style that I found relevant to the rest of the movie's tone. In terms of action, there's a pretty good shovelful of these really badass set pieces that Spielberg is known best for. Also, Spielberg reunites with John Williams to create yet another amazing soundtrack. My only problem with the movie was the ending. While it was pretty uplifting, I didn't really think it fit the tone of the rest of the movie. However, it doesn't take away from the film in any way - I still enjoyed the movie immensely and a happy ending never hurts. Anyway, in the end, I think that \""Minority Report\"" was a near seamless film that was as interesting as it was aesthetic, and fun."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0

Directed by Kevin MacDonald, this movie certainly struck a few dissonant chords with me. I'm not saying the film was bad, in fact I found it \""The Last King Of Scotland\"" to be a very remarkable motion picture. However, it is a deeply disturbing piece that aims to show the audience just how deranged Idi Amin was as Uganda's President. Which brings me to the film's most noteworthy aspect - Forest Whitaker's amazing, Academy-Award Winning turn as Idi Amin himself. Forest Whitaker's performance in \""The Last King Of Scotland\"" is incredibly dynamic because at times I found myself laughing, gasping, and cringing in anger at some of the things that Whitaker did on screen. Some of the stuff that Whitaker's Amin does in this movie is truly frightening and really made me realize just how much of a megalomaniacal sociopath Amin was in real life. In fact there is one moment in this movie (one that I won't fully disclose due to it's grisliness) where I found myself just gaping at my television set - yeah stuff gets pretty grotesque. Obviously, Whitaker rightfully earned the Oscar For Best Actor in 2007. As for James McAvoy, he did a great job in his role as the doctor who just can't seem to escape the madness of Idi Amin, and throughout the movie you really learn to feel for his character. The script, of course, was brilliantly written, as it was adapted from the reportedly excellent Giles Foden novel of the same name. In terms of cinematography, I thought that the film's use of close-up shots on Amin really helped to accentuate his sheer madness and insanity. As for the rest of the camera work everything looks clean and efficient. All in all, I found \""The Last King Of Scotland\"" to be a very remarkable, and disconcerting film that effectively used it's brilliant performances and impressive script to highlight the sheer terror that Idi Amin inflicted upon Uganda and it's people."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0.0
